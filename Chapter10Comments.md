### The Lock: Terminology

**Arabic** As indicated in the introduction, the string of the Asiatic composite bow was drawn and held by the thumb, which in turn was held by the index finger to give what is known as a ‘thumb-lock’, After careful consideration of such evidence as has been available to us - much of it in manuscript - we have come to the conclusion that, whatever extension of meaning it may later have had (e.g. *Arab Archery*, p. 49), the verb *qafala*, ‘to make secure, close, lock’ (noun, *qaflah*), which some authors use in connection with the thumb-lock, originally expressed only the basic action of confining the string with the thumb and index finger. It is difficult to see how it could possibly have been used to indicate the relative positions of the index finger and thumb, to say nothing of the three remaining fingers. This being the case, it is our suggestion that the need to describe the various positions in which the fingers, taken as a whole, could be arranged in order to achieve the thumb-lock imposed the necessity of introducing the verb ‘*aqada* (noun: '*aqd*, plural, *uqūd*) into the archer's vocabulary. The word had the twofold advantage of meaning not only ‘to fasten’, but also ‘to reckon with the fingers’ according to a highly developed and precise system whereby configurations of the fingers of a single hand were employed to convey numerical values (Appendix 4). It could, therefore, be used in conjunction with numerals to communicate exact information about the configuration to be assumed by the fingers when putting a lock on a bowstring. In most contexts, however, *qaflah* - never used by Taybughā - is synonymous with ‘*aqd*, and *qafala*, like '*aqada*, functions with numerals to convey precisely the same information.

**English** Ever since Morse described the various methods of drawing a bowstring as ‘releases’ many English and American authors have applied the term ‘release’ or ‘loose’ to what is in fact a ‘lock’ (hence ‘Fisher loose’, ‘Mediterranean loose’, ‘Flemish loose’, etc.). As the same word is also used in archery to denote the release of the string, it is obvious that ‘lock’ is a more precise and appropriate term so far as the act of holding it is concerned.  Lest the layman be misled, Morse’s ‘Mongolian release’ is none other than the thumb-lock.

### The Locks of ‘63’ and ‘69’

Although Taybughā has obviously taken the trouble to verify the method of communicating the values of sixty-three and sixty-nine these numbers are transposed in ===MSS of the C group=== so that the lock given in the foregoing chapter as ‘69’ is described as '63' and vice versa. When transposed in this way, the locks of ‘63’ and ‘69’ will be found to be identical with those given in *Arab Archery*, p. 43, in which it will be observed that nine is reckoned with the nails of the middle finger, ring-finger, and little finger exposed (p. 20) so that the tips of the fingers rest on the palmar surface near the heel of the hand instead of being pressed into the palm.

There is no doubt that the lock in which the middle finger, ring-finger and little finger are clenched into the palm so that the nails are concealed is the strongest of all locks. We may conclude, therefore, that when the author of the *Nihāyah* asserts that ‘63’ is the strongest, his view of the manner in which it is reckoned is the same as that of the author of Arab Archery, with whom Mustafā Kāni is also in agreement. Practical trials prove that '63' and ‘69 are the two most effective locks, and, although there is evident disagreement about which is which, there is absolutely no doubt about the configurations with which we are dealing.

### Other Locks

According to the author of *Arab Archery*, the locks ‘agreed upon by experts’ numbered six: the '63’, ‘69’, ‘73, ‘83’, ‘24’ (called the *Khusruwāni*, or *Chosroes'* lock) and ‘72' (p. 43).

From the description that he gives of the last-mentioned lock it cannot be that of ‘72' (Arab Archery, p. 43, n. 20). It is, however, our ‘pillion’ lock, or *aqd ar-radif*, otherwise termed *aqd at-tārdif*, and there can be little doubt that Faris and Elmer's ‘reserve draw’ is a translation of *'aqd ar-radīf*; for one meaning which *radif* certainly has, but which is inappropriate in the present context, is ‘reserve’. The pillion lock admitted of variations such as those described, for instance, in the *Tabsirah and the *Nihāyah* (Ch. 8, p. 65), but it seems to have been regarded by most, if not all, authorities as a lock which was awkward or gave a slow loose, and it is even asserted that it resulted in a loose that mainly launched flirting arrows (*sihām mudtaribah*). It is of interest to note that it was the lock used by Japanese archers.

As regards the Chosroes’ lock, it should be noted that to reckon twenty-four amounts to much the same thing as ‘lengthening the long and shortening the short’. The view that it was ‘worthless except in drawing supple bows employed in trick shots’ (*Arab Archery*, p. 43) is not shared by the author of the *Nihāyah* who maintains that it gave a most powerful loose and was extremely good for the arrow.

Among other locks of which we find mention are those of ‘20', used edgewise for shooting a number of arrows simultaneously (*Arab Archery*, p. 149), ‘23’, '30' and ‘37'. Yet others could be enumerated, but enough has been said to illustrate the interesting fact that the number of variations of the thumb-lock used in the East was relatively large, Small variations in forming the lock would be determined partly by personal preference and partly by the relative lengths of the archer’s finger and thumb. It is important that an archer, once having decided which lock is best suited to his needs, should never vary the form as even the slightest alteration will affect the direction of his shots.

### The Position of the String

In discussing the position in which the string should rest against the thumb Taybughā is assuming that the archer is not wearing a ring. There seem to have been as many views on the position of the string in relation to the thumb as there were opinions on how the bow should be grasped and the string locked. The three positions indicated in our text seem to have been the most important, though here again there is considerable disagreement from one writer to another about the persons or schools to whom they should be attributed. We need only say here that the author of *Arab Archery* ascribes the oblique position - said to have been the oldest and that used by expert Persian archers - to Abū Hāshim, the straight position to Tāhir, and the third position - said to give a quicker release than the straight and a greater range than either of the other two - to Ishāq.

Slow and quick releases are related to the speed at which the thumb disengages from the string. A quick release such as can be achieved by the oblique lock adds slightly more velocity to the arrow and can therefore have its advantages. Our author's oblique lock is analogous to the Fisher loose intended for use with the three-finger, or Mediterranean, loose.

Archers will be well aware that to develop a clean and unvarying loose is one of the most difficult facets of technique to achieve.
