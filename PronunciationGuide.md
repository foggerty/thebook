# Pronunciation guide

=== Note that the exxamples need to have body-indent, but not first line.===

In conformity with modern scholarly practice Arabic words and phrases are transliterated according to a system which will be meaningful to all Arabists and familiar to most other serious students of Islamic civilization and culture in the Middle East. The complete layperson will be grateful for the following hints:

## Short Vowels

*a* is pronounced as in *pat*
*i* is pronounced as in *pit*.
*u* is pronounced as in *put*.

## Long Vowels

*ā* is pronounced as in *far*.
*ī* is pronounced as ee in *sheet*.
*ñ* is pronounced as in *lunar*.

## Consonants

*ḍ, ḥ q, ṣ, ṭ, ẓ* are difficult letters and are better pronounced as their nearest English equivalents, viz. d, h, k (not qu), s, t, z, than as the retching, spluttering, or choking sounds so often emitted even by tutored students of Arabic.

*dh* is pronounced as th in *the*.

*gh* represents a guttural *r* somewhat like the burred *r* of Northumbrian English and northern French.

*kh* is pronounced as *ch* in the Scottish loch.

*sh* is pronounced as in shout EXCEPT when the second letter is *ḥ*, in which case the two letters are pronounced independently of one another, as, for instance, in the case of *Isḥāq* (pron. *Iss-hāq*).

*th* is pronounced as in *thing*.

(*'*) is the glottal stop, or a catch of the breath, such as that replacing the t in Cockney, Glaswegian, and Mancunian pronunciations of *water* (wa'er), *butter* (bu'er), etc, It is the sound we hear after *n* in an *ice cream* which, if pronounced without the glottal stop, gives us a nice cream,

(*`*) is a strong guttural peculiar to Arabic and not unlike a forceful glottal stop (*'*) articulated in the depths of the throat. It is *not* a vowel.

*Doubled Consonants*. These should be pronounced as such. Thus, *tt* must be pronounced not as in *better*, but as the two *ts* in *cat tails*, and *shsh* as in *dish shelf*.

The same applies *dh, kh,* and *th*. On occasions *h* may also have: to be pronounced independently, bu the point need not concern us.

*The Arabic Article* (*al*, *l*). This is assimilated to a following *d, ḍ, dh, n, r, s, sh, ṣ, t th, z, ẓ*. Example: *adh-dhirā* (not *al-dhirā*’), *ar-radif* (not *al-radif*). When a proceeding word ends in a vowel, the 'l' form is used, the antecedent vowel replacing the *a* in *al*. Thus, *wa-l-bayt*, not *wal-al-bayt*.

*The Feminine Ending -ah*. When followed by a noun in the genitive, the feminine form ending *-ah* becomes *-āt*. Thus *'uqdat al-ibhām* (not *'uqdah al-ibhām*) 'the joint of the thunb'. the *h* is not pronounced and, in fact, many writers omit it altogether.

In Turkish there are two “i”s, one dotted the other not.
