# Pronunciation guide

In conformity with modern scholarly practice Arabic words and phrases are transliterated according to a system which will be meaningful to all Arabists and familiar to most other serious students of Islamic civilization and culture in the Middle East. The complete layman will be grateful for the following hints:


## Short Vowels

_a_ is pronounced as in pat.
_i_ is pronounced as jn fit.
_u_ is pronounced as in put,


## Long Vowels

 is pronounced as in far.

i is pronounced as ee in sheet. ñ is pronounced as in knar.


## Consonants

d, &, g, 5, b z are difficult letters and are better pronounced as their nearest English equivalents, viz. d, h, k (not qu), s, t, z, than as the retching, spluttering, or choking sounds so often emitted even by tutored students of Arabic.

dh is pronounced as th in the.

gh represents a guttural r somewhat like the burred r of Northumbrian English and northern French.

kh is pronounced as ch in the Scottish loch.

sh is pronounced as in shout EXCEPT when the second letter is 5, in which case the two letters are pronounced independently of one another, as, for instance, in the case of Ishdg (pron. Iss-hdgq).*

th is pronounced as in thing.

()is the glottal stop, or a catch of the breath, such as that replacing the z in Cockney, Glaswegian, and Mancunian pronunciations of water (wa'er), butter (bwer), etc, It is the sound we hear after n in an ice cream which, if pronounced without the glottal stop, gives us a nice cream,

Ç) is a strong guttural peculiar to Arabic and not unlike a forceful glottal stop C) articulated i in the depths of the throat. It is not a vowel.


Doubled Consonants. These should be pronounced as such. Thus, tt must be pronounced not as in better, but as the two rs in cat tails, and shsh as in dish shelf.


The amne applies V di, M, and h. On occasions A may alao hane: to be prononci idepeniensly, bu th point need not concern us.

xiv TRAN SLITERATION AND PRONUNCIATION


The Arabic Article (al, 1). This is assimilated to a following d, d, dh, n, r, s, sh, 5, t sth, f, x, #3 Exx.: adh-dhira' (not al-dhird’), ar-radif (not al-radif). When a i ends in a


vowel, the ‘P form is used, the antecedent vowel replacing the a in al. Thus, wa-}-bayt, not wa-al-bayt.


The Feminine Ending -ah. When followed by a noun in the genitive, the feminine form i


ending ah becomes-at. Thus *ugdat al-ibham (not 'ugdah al-ibhàm) ‘the joint of the thumb’. The & is not pronounced and, in fact, many writers omit it


In Turkish there are two “i”s, one dotted the other not.
