# 8 - On grasping the bow (*qabd*)

Grasping is the act of placing the *matn* of the bow’s grip in the crease which lies between the palm of the hand and the fingers (i.e. the proximal, sometimes called by the author the first crease). This action is discussed first not only because it is the first of the fundamentals, but also because the first thing that a man does to a bow is to apply his grasp to it.  The *matn* is the middle of the back of the bow’s grip.

Now, if the bow’s grip is placed in a man’s grasp after the manner prescribed, the spine of the *matn* (lit. ‘the middle of the *matn*’s back’) should lie in the centre of the proximal phalanges of the fingers. This is Tāhir’s method. It is the best and most practical of all the grasps and the least likely to occasion mishaps. To elaborate: if you wish to grasp the bow for the purpose of shooting, then, with your hand open, first place the *matn* of the bow's grip in the crease between the palm and the fingers. In the case of a big palm with long fingers, the spine of the *matn* must then be placed centrally in the middle crease formed by the fingers (ie. the proximal ingerphalangeal crease, sometimes called in Arabic the second crease). A man with short fingers, on the other hand, should put the *matn* in the first crease, which is the one lying between the base of the fingers and the palm. Finally, a man with medium-sized fingers should place the *matn* of his grip in the centre of the proximal phalanges. I believe this to be a basic operation that is second to none. If your fingers are too long for the grip, you will find it a great advantage to make it thicker by affixing a piece of leather.

Once the grip has been placed in the appropriate hand with fingers outspread, the bow should be grasped with the little finger followed by the second finger. In sequence, the little finger should be applied first, then the second, or ring-finger and finally the third, or middle, finger.  The pressure applied to the grip should grow very much like a building, and just as the archer should grasp first with the little finger and then with the second, so also, if he is to use his fingers (*qubbād*) properly, he should begin by exerting the greatest pressure with the little finger, followed next by the ring-finger until finally the pressure reaches its lowest in the middle finger. You may then also say that under these conditions the pressure on the grip will give a hold as strong as a building, so that the bow will neither deviate nor turn in the hand. The pressure exerted by the grasp should be at its peak the very moment the arrow is loosed.

Once you have a tight hold on the grip with the said three fingers, gently curl over the end of the index finger without tensing it in any way. Fasten it only loosely on the grip, for if you tense the index finger, the other three fingers already tensed will for that very reason relax, and you will accordingly impair your grasp. The rule for the index finger is that it should not be wrapped around the grip. Only the end of it should be bent over the margin of the *matn*, and that is all.

Having bent over the end of the index finger, place your thumb upon it in contact with the grip of your bow. Your thumb must Le as still as a corpse without even the slightest movement.  It should not be pressed into the grip because it forms the guide for the arrow, and if it is tensed the arrow will blister it. Tensing of the thumb will also slacken the grasp.

The grasp just described is the best, the most practical, and the safest of all the various possibilities. It was Tāhir al-Balkhi’s choice [and is known as the grasp of '99'].

Should you wish to use a different grasp from the one I have just mentioned, grasp as before with the three appropriate fingers, but place the end of the thumb over the back of the middle finger. This will give you a different kind of grasp from the first - and a highly important grasp at that. When using it, always tuck in the index finger behind the *matn* so that when the maximum draught (*al-wafā at-tāman*) has been attained at full draw, the finger will not lie in front of the arrowhead, which may subsequently split and injure it. This grasp is extremely useful, and will give a highly effective shot, as well as a good distance in flight shooting. It will enable the archer to draw a longer arrow than is possible with any other kind of grasp [because the base of the thumb can then spread out, thereby allowing the arrowhead to be brought in behind the grip as far as the skill of the archer permits - a considerable advantage in flight shooting involving the use of a single bow and arrow]. Furthermore, the archer's draw on the bow will be much stronger than any other. The Turks call this particular grasp the *changal-i bāz* (Persian: ‘falcon’s talons’). It is the flight shooter's grasp because he can use it to get an extra length of draw on the arrow and bring in the arrowhead right up to the very base of the thumb so that it (i.e. the head) leaves the grip of his bow. This draught has neither superior nor equal because the archer can bring the arrowhead in upon himself (inside the grip).

There are some archers who run the shaft over the ‘proximal’ phalanx of the thumb. This is a perfectly good technique, Others run it over the index finger and slant the thumb towards the arrow. Others there are who set up the thumb and place the index finger beneath it so that they then look as though they are reckoning thirteen (see ===finger-reckoning===). The arrow in this case passes over the top of the thumb-nail. There are yet others who run the arrow over the ends of the index finger and the thumb and look as though they are reckoning thirty.  The first two techniques, however, are to be commended above. all the rest. Those who use the second of these, incidentally, will run the arrow through the middle of the groove formed between the thumb and the index finger. No fault ever results from it.

Do take care lest the ends of the fingers touch the heel of the hand when grasping. I give this grave warning to anyone who would touch the heel of the hand with the ends of his fingers [while grasping], as will indeed be the case if the grip of his bow is too thin or his fingers too long. The point has already been adequately explained.
