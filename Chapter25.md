## On shooting an Enemy in a Well

The way to do this is to stand on the edge of the well as though you were standing to the mark and to draw as though you were shooting at that mark. When you come to the end of [the first half of] your draw, and your right hand is at your left shoulder, you tuck your head in under your right forearm, tilt your left arm downwards as you bring your arrow to full draw, take aim, and shoot at him. Should he have any arrows and shoot at you, he will not hit you whereas your arrows will be right on target and finish him off. If he has a spear, he will certainly not hit you.

## On Shooting from the Top of a Fortress

To shoot at someone moving round a fortress, aim in the same way as you would from the top of a well. Again, tuck your head under your right forearm and tilt your left arm downwards, take aim at your enemy, and shoot him. That is what you do if he is at the bottom of the fortress and shooting from beneath a shield. This can only be achieved by a great deal of practice and experience.

## On Shooting a Horseman in Battle

To engage a horseman in a fixed head-on position, you should sight your bow-hand on the horse’s forehead and shoot. If your arrow flies above the actual mark, it will strike the rider, while if it falls short, it will pierce the horse’s chest. If your shooting is accurate, it will, of course, hit the animal’s forehead. If you have a side view of him in a fixed position, you sight your hand on his buttock. If the arrow flies high, it will go into him, while if it falls short, it will pierce the horse’s flank. If he is moving and going to ride past you, you shoot in front of him by the length of another horseman or slightly more according to the speed at which he is moving.

# On Determining Whether an Arrow is Fast or Slow

To do this, you stand still and aim at a mark sixty bows’ distance away (about 75 yds.) and then shoot. From the moment the arrow leaves the bow till the time it drops at the mark you count. If, by then, you have counted six, your performance is average. 1f you count less, your shaft is fast; if you count more, it is slow.

## On the Assessment of Grouping

To discover how well he is grouping, an archer should set up an object five spans [in diameter] (about 38 in.) at sixty bows’ distance (about 75 yards) and shoot. If he can concentrate his arrows in that object, his grouping is good.

## On Ensuring a Low Trajectory

For this purpose you take two staves, each of the height to which you can reach, and set them up five cubits apart across the centre of a short range. You then take a rope, fasten it to them, and shoot. If your arrows fly under the rope to the mark, their trajectory is sufficiently low (*lāti*), whereas if they go over it, their trajectory is too high (*murtafi*).

## On Determining Dexterity

Quickness and ease in using your hands are a commendable asset in battle. If you wish to determine your dexterity and rate of shooting, you take three arrows and stand and shoot over sixty bows' distance (about 75 yards). If you can shoot the third and only see the dust of the first after that third arrow has already left your hand, you are fast enough. If you can't, you must practise holding the arrows all together between your fingers and shoot in this way. You keep on practising until you achieve your goal.

## On the Razor-arrow (*Sahm al-mūs*)

This is a battle stratagem. You get a war arrow and bore a hole down the centre of the notch (*kaz*). You next get the smith to make you some small pieces of metal the sizeof the notch and on these you put an edge as fine as that of a razor. They should have a tang (*silān*) to fit the hole you have drilied in the notch of your arrow. They look like this:

== NEED PICURES HERE ==

You equip your quiver with a number of arrows of this type, and when you have a first-class archer to deal with, you get some eagle quills and, having cut them into lengths as long as the width of two fingers and split them down one side, you then fit them over the bowstring at the nocking-point and use them to shoot a razor-arrow at your archer. If he picks the arrow up and shoots it back at you, it will sever his bowstring and put a stop to his shooting. Whereupon, you can move in on him with all speed to do with him what you will. At the right time and place this is a handy device.

## On the Nochless Arrow

To shoot nockiess arrows at the enemy, you take a strong iron link (*zaradah*) and bind it into the bowstring. As for the arrows, you cut away the part containing the notch and thin down the end so that it will fit into the link on the string. You can then lock and shoot. If accurate, it will do its work, If not, you will very likely have shot an arrow which the enemy, if not acquainted with missiles of this type, will be unable to shoot back at you.

Some archers use loops of twine instead of links - one for each arrow. In such a case the loop is folded in two around the bowstring and used to shoot a nockless arrow. This method is not as obvious as the first because the ring flies off unobserved along with the arrow. Others use a short tube (*julbah*) of iron, copper, [or bone] just big enough to take arrow nocks and as long as the width of two fingers. One end should be stopped and fitted with a silk tassel to keep it from slipping out of the drawing hand. The *julbah* is then slotted lengthwise as far as the half-way mark, the slot being just wide enough to take the bowstring. To use this device, they proceed as follows. First, the bowstring is inserted, then the nockpiece of the arrow is cut off, and the arrow placed in the *julbah*. The archer can then lock and shoot. It is a really cunning device.

A *julbah* is also perfectly suitable for use with an arrow of the concealed razor type. You can split the nock and, having worked the razor into a two-edged blade like a spearhead, fit it down the centre of the fissure. Once it has been inserted, the nock is bound back over it, and the arrow kept until needed. When the occasion arises, you can shoot it in a *julbah* without your bowstring's ever entering the notch. This is a far more effective arrow than the first in which the razor is fitted with a tang, and it is less obvious to the enemy, for he will not detect the trick.

## On Shooting Iron Pellets and the Incendiary Egg!**

These missiles form part of the repertory of devices that are of value in battle and siege operations. When the occasion demands, the pellets (*bunduq*) are heated to glowing point in a fire and used as incendiaries. Along with the pellet one uses other kinds of projectile made out of naphtha. Thus an egg may be drained and filled with resin or some naphtha compound which can then be ignited and shot either at the enemy himself or at some fortress in which bales of cotton have been used to block breaches, such as we have heard was done at the siege of Acre. To shoot flaming pellets on dark nights is one of the most effective stratagems that can be used against an army. For this purpose a copper tube (*julbah*) [expanding into an inverted cone] is used. One end of it should be a snug fit for an iron pellet, while the other, which is smaller (sic; ‘bigger’ is required), should be just big enough to take the egg funnelwise - for which purpose it is to be used. Both are mounted on the foreshaft like a scroll. An arrow that is to be used in this way should not be fletched, but have a hole bored in it near the nock. Through this hole a cord should be threaded with which to tie the arrow to the bowstring so that it cannot fly free when shot. With another cord the arrow is tied to the grip, but not so tightly that it will held fast when shot. Some suitable packing is put into the tube to prevent the end of the arrow from being burned. If the pellets are kept small and shot in this way they can be used to great effect against an enemy and be fatal to beasts of burden and persons not wearing armour.

For shooting pellets one may also make a steel or copper guide (*mijāt*) of a similar type to that called the ‘king-guide’ and fix copper tubing to the bowstring instead of the [usual] leather band (*tasmā*) which is there. It is termed *maydāni*. If an iron striker just thick enough to ride down the guide and as long as the width of the archer's thumb can be made, all the better. To accommodate the bowstring, a hole of the same diameter should be drilled right through it. It is a well-tried and useful contrivance.
