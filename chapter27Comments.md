970 COMMENT 1. The Training of an Archer


An important part of Mustafa Kani’s manual is devoted to a description of the guild of Turkish archers, the conduct of its business, the acceptance of novices, rules of practice, and ethics (Hein, /s?., XV, pp. 241 ff. Cf. Klopsteg, pp. 106 ff.). It is regrettable that nothing wholly comparable is contained in our treatise, for the rules of practice and ethical standards expounded in the above chapter and the one that is to follow are discernibly associated with some system of professional organization similar in kind to that described by G. Baer in his analysis of guild structure in seventeenth-century Egypt (Egyptian Guilds, pp. 49 fÈ). There we encounter a hierarchy of masters, master-apprentices, and ordinary apprentices, all subject to the authority of a leading member, or shaykh, and enjoying the spiritual patronage of some venerated per- sonage often belonging to the generation of the Prophet.

971Within this hierarchical system the first step of the apprentice (talib, muta'allim, mubtadi) was to attach himself to his occupational group by establishing a personal relationship with a master (usta, or ustádh, mu'allim, munta(h)i) whose business it would be to instruct him in the secrets of the craft and the traditions, rituals, and religious ceremonies peculiar to his group.  After an initial period of probation the novice entered into a covenant Cahd) with his master who bound him by oath to the observance of certain duties (cf. that described below, p. 157). His ordinary apprenticeship served, he qualified in due course for guild membership as master- apprentice, or journeyman, The next and, for most ordinary members the final, step was the attainment of a licence (jdzah) to practise as a master. On each of the four occasions mentioned formal proceedings with prayers and a greater or lesser degree of ritual were held in the presence of officers or members of the guild (ikheodn, ‘brethren’.

To judge from all that is inferable from the sources available to us, the career of a Mameluke archer, mutatis mutandis, followed a similar kind of course within the same kind of institutional framework, though there are indications that it was not as rigid or elaborate as some may care to think.

972 2. Rules of Practice


Most contemporary Western instructors would approve the principles of training advocated in the text. At the heart of the matter is the concept that the beginner should learn to use a bow without actually discharging an arrow so that, undistracted by the behaviour of the missile, he may concentrate on handling the weapon in the approved manner. Only after the attainment of reasonable proficiency in this respect should he be allowed to shoot arrows,

973When the shooting stage is reached, there is much merit in discouraging the use of a target until

974 the pupil has learned to group his arrows to the best of his ability. Good grouping will indicate that he has achieved a consistent technique—the essence of good shooting—and is ready to attempt the relatively simple step of placing a group around the centre of a target.

The baztiyyah, or practice drum, according to Reinaud, was a kind of barrel covered at one end with a cow hide so as to give a target face and mounted at breast-height on a four-legged stand (FA, 1848, pp. 218-19). A stuffed bag or sack (torba) similarly mounted and angled at about 44° is mentioned by Mustafa Kani as a taining device for flight shooting (Hein, Isl., XV, PP. 255-56, figs. 37 and 38. Cf. Klopsteg, pp. 112-13 and fig 42). The diameter of the drum is not given, but we conjecture that it was on the small side with a diameter of 2 feet or so.

975 3. Ethics and Courtesy


-Quite apart from drill, discipline, and orderliness, the commendable theme of politeness and good manners seems to have attached itself to archery from the earliest times. The motto of the Grand National Archery Society, viz. “Union, True Heart, and Courtesie’, echoes the spirit of a Chinese poem dating from the second or third century B.C.:

976 Clout and pin-hole are marked, already is hung The shooting-target, where with bow in hand, And arrows under arm Each archer does obeisance to each, Willing to yield his rights of precedence.  (‘The Great Summons’, Waley, Chinese Poems, p. 42.)


The standards of conduct laid down in our text are ageless and, religious aspects apatt, are as closely followed today as they must have been a thousand years ago.

977 4. The Ghunyah and a Passage in Al-Jabarti’s ' Aja'ib


Between the code of ethics and behaviour communicated by our author and that laid down in an jázah, or licence, granted to a Cairene bowyer of the eighteenth century there is a striking similarity which will not elude those intimately acquainted with al-Jabarti’s chronicle, ‘Aja’ib al-athdr, in which the second is recorded (Cairo edo., A.H. 1322, II, pp. 227-30. Cf. Baer, op. cit., PP. 52-53). In tone and phraseology the text of the Egyptian raza is, as a whole, so reminiscent of Taybughi's treatise that there can be little doubt that the latter is the source of its inspiration.  By comparison with examples of ijázahs known to us from our manuscript sources, that quoted by al-Jabarti is an elaborate affair and cannot be regarded as typical of the period which directly concerns us. It does, however, testify to the currency and authority of Taybugha’s work.
