# On locking and counting (*'aqd*)

[The act of locking the fingers on the bowstring and about the arrow's nock is termed *'aqd*, which also denotes the act of reckoning by the use of different finger positions] (Appendix 4).  The method [which I recommend] consists in locking your fingers in the position in which they would be for the purpose of representing sixty-nine. Some allege that my lock of ‘69’ is that of ‘63’, but in fact you conceal the finger-nails, and when you do that, you reckon nine, [not three].  We have gone into this point with those who are conversant with finger-reckoning and found it to be a fact. Those who use the system differ about the manner jn which three should be reckoned, but as regards nine there is no disagreement.

What you do to obtain the lock of ‘69’ is to gather the little finger, the ring-finger, and the middle finger of [the drawing hand] into the centre of the palm and then to conceal the finger-nails.  This gives you nine. You next place the tip of the thumb in the centre of the middle phalanx of the middle finger and wrap the end of the index finger over the base of the thumb-nail. You will then have reckoned sixty-nine. This is the right and proper lock which [all good] archers use.

When drawing the bow, lodge the string in the crease of the thumb, or, to be more precise, in the proximal margin of the joint between the two phalanges of the thumb. By so doing you will provide the string with a rest (*maqarr*) from which it will not slip when the bow is drawn. This rest is the place in which the string should always be lodged, for it is the right and proper place (i.e. if a bare thumb or simple leather guard is used, for with a ring the string is positioned above the joint). If the little finger, ring-finger, and middle finger are strongly pressed home, an extremely firm lock will follow. Such treatment is essential because it is upon the pressure of these three fingers [with concealment of the nails] that a good strong lock depends.

After pressing home the said three fingers, put the tip of the thumb on the centre of the middle phalanx of the middle finger and keep it there the whole of the time from the very moment you loose. Next, cover the base of the thumb-nail with the middle phalanx of the right index finget, the base of the thumb-nail being the point from which it commences growth, or the end opposite to that which is cut when it is too long. What you do is to place the middle phalanx of the right index finger on the junction of the nail and flesh [of the thumb]. See that some of the thumb-nail remains visible—don't conceal it completely. An archer, incidentally, when paring his nails, should take care not to be too hard on his thumb-nail [because it protects the flesh at the end]. It is, in fact, better to leave the nail alone in times of war or when there is a lot of shooting to be done.

The real art of locking lies in pressing the end of the right index finger on the thumb without too much bending, for if the right index finger bends and curls around the thumb, the finger will not respond as it should upon release. With archers this is a common fault, the term for which is *kuzzāz* (i.e. ‘spasm’, which, strictly speaking, is the result of a fault rather than the fault itself). It will result in the string’s rapping the end of the right index finger because it is bent too far around the thumb. It is, then, not only a fault, but also a cause of injury, so do beware of it.

You may also use the pillion lock (*'aqd ar-radif*) which is well suited to bows that are strong, stiff, and powerful, but it gives a slow release. What you do in this case is to lock as already indicated above, but then to mount the middle finger on the right index finger and place it on the thumb beside the index finger.

You may also use the lock of ‘63’, which is the same as that of ‘69’, except that the nails are visible in this case, but are concealed in the other. Then again, there is the lock of '73' and that of ‘22’. The latter is called the ‘clinging’ lock and applies to the left hand when holding the arrow in place along with the grip of the bow during the nocking operation.

There is also the Slav ('*agd ag-Saqālibah*) lock in which the archer puts his three middle fingers on the string and extends the index finger along the shaft of the arrow. The thumb has no place in this lock, for which they make finger guards of gold, silver, iron, and copper.  With this lock the bow is held in the vertical position (*wāqifah*).

Finally, you have the ancient Arab lock of pre-Islamic times. With this you draw with the four fingers minus the thumb. Some would draw in this manner holding the bow in a horizontal position (rāqidah), The arrow was placed between the middle finger and the ring-finger and they would draw to the breast.

‘Apart from the ‘69’, the ‘pillion’, and the ‘63’, none of these locks is of any advantage, but it may happen that they could be required for some contingency or special purpose - for which reason they are mentioned here.

A straight lock (*al-istiaā*) will give a steadier draw, and an oblique (*at-tahrif*) a speedier dispatch to your arrow (i.e. result in a faster loose, which will add a little velocity to the arrow; it is achieved by the greater speed at which the thumb will disengage from the string). Some archers place the string a little in front of the crease of the thumb-joint in the direction of the tip.  This is a good technique giving a fast loose (*sari al-iflāt*) and good cast (*jārid li-s-sahm*).

The main principle behind these observations is that for every type of finger there is a particular lock, just as for every type of palm there is a particular grasp. The lock of Bahāam (*al-‘aqd al-Bahrāmi*), for example, involves lengthening the short, that is, the thumb, and shortening the long, that is, the right index finger. Chosroes’ lock (*al-‘aqd al-Khusrawāni*) is the reverse of that of Bahrām - it involves lengthening the long and shortening the short. [The lock may be varied, then, to suit the individual, but] the nock of the arrow may not be shortened [to suit the lock].  It is a great fault, so beware. (His meaning is: if as a result of the kind of lock which you adopt, you find the end of the nock pressing against any part of your thumb or index finger, you must not shorten the nock to remove this pressure, You must either take a different lock or accept the pressure.)
