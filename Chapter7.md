#  7 - On the fundamentals of archery

Among countless numbers of [fable] bowmen those most famed for their knowledge and skill in archery are Bahrām Gúr ibn Yazdigird ibn Shāpūr Dhū l-Aktāf, Tāhir al-Balkhi, Ishaq ar-Raffā, and Abū Hāshim al-Bāwardi. These were the men who won renown for their methods of shooting, and from ancient times right up to the present people have been adherents of their teachings. At-Tabari it was who transmitted their techniques, though his own method was eclectic.

Each of these Great Masters had a method of his own which suited the requirements of his trunk and limbs, depending, as will be mentioned in due course, on whether his measurements were long, short, or medium and whether he had a broad chest with a long arm-span or vice versa.  Rarely will any one man in all respects be of exactly the same proportions as any single one of the Masters. On the contrary, physical proportions are bound to differ from one person to another.  You will, therefore, appreciate that all methods must really be eclectic (*ikhtiyāri*) according to the different requirements imposed by the size of one’s trunk and limbs.

There are differences of opinion on what constitutes the fundamentals of archery (*usūi ar-rany*). According to Abū Hāshim, they are four: grasping, locking, drawing, and releasing.  To these Tāhir added sighting, thus making them five. The majority of archers follow this teaching and quote the following verses:

> ‘Archery is the finest thing that God's Messenger (Muhammad) recommended, and the manliest of men are those who can be proud of their shooting.  Its fundamentals are five, of which the first is the grasp, followed by locking, drawing, releasing, and sighting.’

Some add nocking and make the fundamentals six. This is the number we adopt for the simple reason that a fundamental of anything is that which is indispensable to it, and, as nocking is indispensable to archery, it is therefore a fundamental. There are some who add stringing, but strictly speaking stringing is connected with the art of bow making because it requires a knowledge of how to adjust the bow, how to correct any distortions in its curvature (*taqwim i wijājihi*), and how to prepare strings.

### The Masters of Archery and the Great Masters

A Persian ruler of the Sasanid dynasty, Bahrām Gūr, or Vahram V (A.D. 420-38), is frequently accorded a prominent position in archery literature. In the works of poets and illuminators (mainly Persian) his legendary feats as an archer and hunter are a commonplace. He is 'Bahrām, that great Hunter’ whose name is known to many through Fitzgerald's *Rubāiyāt of Omar Khayyān*. In technical writings certain styles of shooting and points of technique are not infrequently ascribed to, or associated with, the Sasanid kings, and in this connection the names of Ardashir (Ardashir I, son of Papak, A.D. 226-41) and Khusraw (Chosroes I, A.D. 531-79) are to be found in addition to that of Bahrām Gūr.

An examination of Mardi’s *Tabsirah*, which we know to have been written in the time of Saladin, reveals among acknowledged exponents of archery a preponderance of persons whose names bespeak their role as repositories, transmitters, and continuators of the techniques of Central Asia and the Iranian cultural orbit of medieval times. Typical are the following examples: as-Sarakhsi, ‘of Sarakhs’, between Meshed and Merv (Khorasan), at-Tirmidhi, ‘of Termez’, on the Upper Oxus near Balkh (Khorasan, now in Uzbekistan), al-Harawi, ‘of Herat’ (Khorasan, now in N.W. Afghanistan) as-Samarqandi, ‘of Samarkand’, principal town of Transoxiana (now capital of the province of Samarkand in Uzbekistan). Names of this kind, though generally less numerous than in the Tabstrah, could easily be cited from other Arabic and Islamic treatises on archery. Furthermore, the ascription of this or that technique to the men of Merv or Balkh, for instance, or to the people of Khorasan or Transoxiana is not an unusual phenomenon.

The dates at which the archers named by Mardi flourished - among them Tahir, Ishāq, and Abū Hāshim mentioned in the first paragraph of this chapter - have so far defied our attempts at discovery. Indeed, for all the pre-eminence with which Tahir, Ishaq, and Abū Hashim subsequently emerge in Islamic archery literature as the Imams, or ‘Great Masters’, of technique, we have yet to uncover any biographical details that will shed light on their dates. To judge from their names, they were certainly all Muslims and therefore could not have antedated the first quarter of the seventh century A.D., and, as they are mentioned by Mardi, the second half of the twelfth century can be taken as a rough *terminus ante quem*. To suppose that they lived no earlier than the middle of the eighth century would, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, be a reasonable guess since it was from early Abbasid times that large-scale recruitment of troops and officials from Khorasan and Transoxiana began. Other possibilities suggest themselves, but hypothesis is no substitute for factual evidence.

In the matter of dates this is as far as we can go. As regards Abū Hashim, it is important to dispel all doubts surrounding what, for convenience's sake, we will call his cognomen. The problem is that archery literature confronts us with four possibilities, viz. al-Bāwardi, -Bārūdi, -Māwardi, -Nāawardi. So far as Taybugha's treatise is concerned, A and the MSS of the B group limit the choice to al-Bārūdi and al-Bāwardi. Of these the first is the relative adjective of a small town in Lower Egypt, while the second is that of Abiward, or Bāward, a town and district on the northern slopes of the mountains of Khorasan in an area now within Turkmenistan. Having regard to our observations in the first two paragraphs above and bearing in mind the reputation and prowess of the archers of Khorasan, we take Abū Hāshim al-Bāwardi to be the man’s true name and believe Faris and Elmer’s - and indeed Hein’s - Abū Hāshim al-Māwardi to be erroneous (Arab Archery, p. 16). To an Arabist it will be obvious how readily the rather unusual Bāwardi could be transformed by a scribe into the much more familiar Māwardi or the easier Bārūdi, or else be corrupted to the meaningless Nāwardi as in the *Tabsirah*.

The second element of the name Ishāq ar-Raffa is taken by Faris and Elmer to be ar-Raqqi, ‘of Raqqah', a place in northern Syria, but this reading runs counter to an overwhelming weight of evidence in favour of *ar-Raffa* and is an obvious orthographic error.

As regards Tāhir al-Balkhi, the second half of his name links either him or his forebears with Balkh, now a village in northern Afghanistan, but once a great capital of Khorasan and a centre renowned, among other things, for the excellence of its horsemen and archers. In Arab Archery, p. 114, he is made out to be the grandson of Shāpūr Dhū l-Aktāf (Shapur II, A.D. 309-79), but if the author of the Tabsirah is correct in naming him Tāhir ibn Mubammad, he would have been a Muslim and (unless he was a convert adopting the patronymic ‘ibn Muhammad’ - which is most unlikely) the son of a Muslim, and could obviously not have been the grandson of a man who died two and a half centuries before Islam.

In at-Tabari (‘of Tabaristān', a Persian province south of the Caspian) we have to do with Ahmad ibn 'Abd Allāh Muhibb ad-Din at-Tabari (d. 1295?) who was the author of *The Clear Book on Archery* (*Kitāb al-wādih fi r-ramy*, etc.) of which there are several extant manuscripts. He has no connection whatever with the great historian and scholar Abū Ja'far Muhammad ibn Jarir at-Tabari (A.D. 839-923) as certain Muslim authors seem to think (e.g. Mustafā Kani in Hein, ibid., p. 299). From his own testimony we learn that he was trained in the teaching of Abū Hāshim by Muhammad ibn 'Isa s-Samar-qandi, in that of Tāhir al-Balkhi by ‘Abd ar-Rahmān al-Farāwi (‘of Fariwah’, now Kızıl Arvat, Turkmenistan), and in that of Ishaq ar-Raffā by Abū Sa‘id al-Khwārizmi (‘of Khwārizm’, now Khiva, Uzbekistan).

### The Fundamentals of Archery

Taybugha's statement that there were differences of opinion regarding the number of fundamentals is amply borne out by what we have learned of the subject from several other Islamic manuals, In general the authors of these works go into much greater detail than does Taybugha and deal not only with the ‘roots’, or fundamentals, but also with the ‘branches’ (*furū*), or secondary bases, of archery (e.g. Arab Archery, p. 17). An enumeration and discussion of conflicting views on the number and nature of these ‘roots and branches’ are beyond the scope of the present work. Nevertheless, we feel obliged to comment, firstly, that the fundamentals attributed by Taybughà to Abū Hashim and Tahir do not wholly agree with those ascribed to them, for instance, by at-Tabari and the author of Arab Archery (whose information may well have been derived from the *Wādih*) and, secondly, that our author makes no mention whatsoever of any views held on the subject by Ishāq.

The fundamentals ascribed to Ishāq by at-Tabari are:

1. Standing to the mark (*al-initsāb ilā l-'alāmah) so that it is in line with the left eye.
2. Bracing (*itār*), or stringing.
3. Nocking.
4. Clench.
5. Grasp.
6. Aiming.
7. Drawing to the mouth (*al-jarr 'ala l-fam*)
8. Halting of the arrowhead between the knuckles (or, perhaps, 'phalanges') of the thumb.
9. Loosing.
10. Letting the left hand go forward (*al-fathah bi-si-shamāl*).
