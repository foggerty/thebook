#  7 - On the fundamentals of archery

Among countless numbers of [fable] bowmen those most famed for their knowledge and skill in archery are Bahrām Gúr ibn Yazdigird ibn Shāpūr Dhū l-Aktāf, Tāhir al-Balkhi, Ishaq ar-Raffā, and Abū Hāshim al-Bāwardi. These were the men who won renown for their methods of shooting, and from ancient times right up to the present people have been adherents of their teachings. At-Tabari it was who transmitted their techniques, though his own method was eclectic.

Each of these Great Masters had a method of his own which suited the requirements of his trunk and limbs, depending, as will be mentioned in due course, on whether his measurements were long, short, or medium and whether he had a broad chest with a long arm-span or vice versa.  Rarely will any one man in all respects be of exactly the same proportions as any single one of the Masters. On the contrary, physical proportions are bound to differ from one person to another.  You will, therefore, appreciate that all methods must really be eclectic (*ikhtiyāri*) according to the different requirements imposed by the size of one’s trunk and limbs.

There are differences of opinion on what constitutes the fundamentals of archery (*usūi ar-rany*). According to Abū Hāshim, they are four: grasping, locking, drawing, and releasing.  To these Tāhir added sighting, thus making them five. The majority of archers follow this teaching and quote the following verses:

> ‘Archery is the finest thing that God's Messenger (Muhammad) recommended, and the manliest of men are those who can be proud of their shooting.  Its fundamentals are five, of which the first is the grasp, followed by locking, drawing, releasing, and sighting.’

Some add nocking and make the fundamentals six. This is the number we adopt for the simple reason that a fundamental of anything is that which is indispensable to it, and, as nocking is indispensable to archery, it is therefore a fundamental. There are some who add stringing, but strictly speaking stringing is connected with the art of bow making because it requires a knowledge of how to adjust the bow, how to correct any distortions in its curvature (*taqwim i wijājihi*), and how to prepare strings.
