# 28 - On the duties and qualities of a master and teacher

A teacher’s first duty is to exercise power of discernment. By this we mean that he will need, firstly, to determine a person’s physical capacity in the light of the fact that there are different somatic types and that some people have longer or shorter limbs than others, and, secondly, to detect a pupil’s natural intelligence or obtuseness and his ability, or lack of it, to assimilate what he is taught.

His next step will be to subject the novice to a religious test if he is an adult; for if he is a boy the permission of his parents will be required. Once he is satisfied that he is a Muslim, he should extract from him an undertaking that he will shoot no other Muslim, nor any non-Muslim enjoying treaty rights, nor any dog, nor any four-footed animal, except in hunting or unless it be something which must of necessity be destroyed, nor anything that will involve him in an act of injustice. Once he is sure that his pupil will accept all these conditions and is satisfied with his religious qualifications, he should take him and endeavour to instruct him according to the requirements of his physique as indicated above and should counsel him once he is sure that he is worthy of instruction. For it has been transmitted from an authoritative source that to withhold learning from one who is worthy of it is not lawful. Such a one must be granted a share thereof as of right, especially if he appreciates the value of learning, longs for it, and seeks God's good pleasure and not vainglory and vanity. In this connexion experts on archery quote religious scholars as their authority for the maxim: ‘Neither withhold advantage from those who are worthy of it, and thereby do them wrong, nor grant it to those who are unworthy and, thus squandering it, do advantage wrong.’

As to a master’s duties, he should train his pupils, bring them together in unity and concord, spur them on to work, reprimand them only in private, and labour to the end that they may strive to learn and ever reverence the place dedicated to archery, wherein none should be allowed to utter any profanity, inasmuch as it is a place of worship, and places of worship belong to God.

Proceedings should be opened with the formula ‘In the name of God’. Upon loosing, the formula ‘God is greatest’ should be pronounced, and, after that, God's blessing upon the Messenger of God, his family, and his Companions should be invoked. Where it is merited, the master should compliment a shooter to encourage him. He should teach his pupils all that is good and at the same time restrain them from all that is bad.

A master should be taciturn and of dignified bearing and commanding presence, yet not haughty. He should be stable and patient and not too hasty with his answers. All kinds of learning may be observed in all mankind, and there is no one who does not have some share in God's bounty. It is desirable that a master should have the strength of an elephant, the spring of a lion, the boldness of a leopard, and the cunning of a fox; that he should have for his colleagues the affection that a dog has for its master; that he should exercise the patience of a cat. He should make the sword his companion, the lance his friend, the shield his fortress, the dagger his secret weapon. He should display great tolerance and be indulgent. The beginning of all things is piety which is a man’s capital stock. These, then, are some of the qualities which a teaching master should possess.  As regards the qualities required of a novice, some of these have already been mentioned. The foundations upon which they all rest are humility, hearing attentively and obeying that which is pleasing to God Almighty and His Messenger — may God bless him, his house and his Companions, and grant them peace!
