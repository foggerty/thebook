# 15 - On shooting from horseback

According to traditional teaching propounded both by Turks well-versed in our subject and by horsemen trained in the art of mounted combat, shooting as practised by horse-archers falls into two main classes, namely, that known as ‘shooting at a slant’ (*righaj; qiqaj*) wherein the archer directs his shot downwards, and that known as 'gourd-shooting' (*qabaq*) wherein he shoots up into the sky. Both classes are fundamentally alike in that each requires the rider first to come to a canter in which he gradually builds up the speed of his mount, next to put it to a gallop, and then after shooting to turn off at the end of the course.  The arrow is shot at full gallop, or, in other words, after the horse has attained full stride and is in mid-career. After the arrow has been discharged the horse should continue its gallop ‘[to the end of the field].

In either type of shooting it is essential first to gain a sound knowledge of equitation, to acquire practice and skill with horses, to ride them in attack and retreat, to learn to control a horse's head with the bridle, and so on, until finally the rider is thoroughly accustomed to such details, and they become a matter of habit to him. All this constitutes a highly important skill which must be acquired by every horseman, particularly the Mameluke trooper. The technique is best learned from masters in the art of lancing, for they have a greater knowledge and experience of these things than anyone else. It is from such mentors that one learns the art of thrusting and parrying with the lance as well as the technique of wielding the mace, sword play, and so on. Those who attain perfection in such matters will have attained perfection in the art and manners of the mounted warrior.

A combination of all these skills has only ever been brought to full perfection in the case of certain Turks in Islam (the Bahrī Mamelukes?) and those mounted champions of religion, the Companions of the Prophet. To their innate skill in the art of mounted combat such men added a skill and valour in faith, witness, and religious certitude together with a readiness to sacrifice their lives for the love of God and the sake of His good pleasure as well as love of His Messenger, Muhammad. No nation ever offered them resistance nor was there ever any nation with which they waged war but they buried it, humbled it, or took it by the forelock. With succeeding generations, however, the bonds which had held their predecessors together weakened as a result of disintegration, lack of cohesion, and a paucity of entrants [for military training of the kind described, When this happened], they were overtaken by weakness and debility commensurate with the loss of solidarity they had sustained . . .

The horse-archer should control his horse’s head with a martingale (*sirifsār*) and fit an 'aid' (*musta'ān*) to hold the reins in place. The martingale is a familiar piece of equipment, the purpose of which is to control the head of a horse whose neck is poorly bent to the bridle, The need for it arises because a mount of this kind, when pressed by its rider, will put its head down and toss it up and, in consequence, gallop uncollectedly. It is therefore liable either to fall or strike its rider [in the chest] with its head. This, then, is why a mount whose neck is not properly bent to the bridle must be equipped with a martingale.

Our second item, the aid, is a folded strap fitted to the end of the reins to enable the rider to keep them securely in his right hand. It should be fitted under the knot that fastens the reins together at the top, and a second knot tied in the reins to limit the movement of the horse’s head when necessary. This second knot will be quite familiar to cavalrymen and equerries from its use on the polo field. The pommel, which goes in between the reins, should lie below the second knot (i.e. the reins as shortened by the second knot may be slipped over the pommel, which will keep them in place and hold the horse's head).

Because of the harassing discomforts it may cause, the mace should be placed beneath the stirrup-leather to prevent it from shifting about. The mace is familiar enough to require no comment, There are certain horsemen, however, who are ignorant of the techniques of the cavalryman, and, when such a one gallops his horse, his mace shifts about beneath his thigh and works its way out, with the result that it either hampers the rider or drops off. The proper procedure in this case is for the rider to secure the shaft of his mace well in beneath the leather so as to allow it no freedom of movement whatever. Although this is all commonplace so far as the instructed are concerned, it is not so with the majority of people. The point must therefore be mentioned because the purpose of manuals is to instruct the ignorant and to remind the conversant of what they may have forgotten or overlooked.

The aid should be secured to the right hand by means of a ‘retainer’ (*mahbas*) on the ring-finger.  This item is fastened to the aid by a thin thong and serves to attach the aid to the ring-finger to prevent it from slipping from its grasp when shooting. This operation should be carried out after mounting.

In sitting a horse it is of fundamental importance for the rider to sit erect in the middle of its back and then to lean forward slightly as he breaks into a canter (or, according to another version, 'to sit up straight at the canter and then to lean forward slightly as he puts his mount to full gallop’). The inclination should be such that it is imperceptible; it is only a slight inclination accompanying a forward rise as the knees are pressed in firmly to grip the horse.

The length of the stirrup is determined by the length of the rider’s leg, for horsemen differ in size, and each man has his own particular length. The stirrup must be made to fit the leg and be neither too long nor too short, but, as has been proved by experience, correspond exactly to the length of the leg. What the rider should do is to sit erect in the centre of the saddle, slip his fest from the stirrups, let them hang down, and look at their position. If the bottom edge of the stirrup touches the inner ankle-bone, the heel of the foot being always lower than the stirrup, this will give the correct measurement. If the edge is higher or lower, it should be lengthened or shortened accordingly until it is of the appropriate length. This is an important and well-respected principle which it will be profitable to observe.

To lodge the little toes in the stirrup, they should be pressed against the outer support of the latter, the outer being the opposite of the inner which lies next to the animal. The foot itself should be pressed down in a horizontal position. In other words, no part of the foot, whether toes or heel, should point upwards or downwards. On the contrary, both toes and heel should be on the same level and be held firmly in position—though there is something to be said for having the heel dip slightly from the stirrup towards the ground. The foot should not be brought so close to the horse’s flank as to touch it, but rather held a little way away from it. It should not, however, be too far out from the animal's flank, but as close as it may be without actually touching it, except when the mount is given the heel; The knees and calves, on the other hand, should be held well into the animal. When kicking the horse's flank with the spur, the position of the latter should be a span or less away from the site of the girth. It should be no further away than that, otherwise it is a fault in the eyes of the cavairyman.

Holding the reins with middle finger and ring-finger, the archer should grasp the bow with the whole hand. In other words, he should set the whole of his palm and his fingers to the handle of his bow and, using only the middle finger and ring-finger of the same hand, hold the reins in the middle until the moment he draws [so that he can nock]. Once he is at the draw, it makes no difference whether the reins are slipped or not.

When charging, he stands in the stirrups and leans forward ever so slightly, taking care not to lean over too far. It is a half, and not a full, standing position that is required as the rider rises in his stirrups. In precise terms, he should stand in this manner and lean forward slightly over the saddle-bow, bending his waist over a little so as to set his navel on it.

In grasping the arrow it is of fundamental importance for the archer to take it up with the whole of his hand and all fingers as he would a stave. Its nock should be pointing to his rear and its head - to his fore, and the shaft held in his grasp at a point two-thirds of its length away from the head. After grasping the arrow in this way he nocks, setting it on the string with the three appropriate fingers in the usual way as described earlier. When the arrow is nocked, its head should occupy a position between the horse's ears, but above the animal’s head without catching it at all.

Kicking the horse into the charge, nocking the arrow, drawing the bow with the arrow in place, and slipping the rein from the left hand should all be carried out after the manner of a single operation. The charger by this time should be in full career, and, as soon as the archer has completed the sequence of operations just described, he should hold himself [at the draw] as still as some bird that stills its wings in flight and holds them motionless, such as the vulture, eagle, or the like. To put the matter plainly, he should move the bow neither up nor down with his left forearm, The same rule applies to his right arm. In other words, both arms should be kept in the same plane as his horse continues to charge as fast as it possibly can.

A point that should have been made is this: lest the horse flag at the gallop and need to be whipped, the rider should be equipped with a switch that can be secured to the ring-finger of his right hand along with the aid that is holding the reins. This he can then use to whip up his flagging charger before taking up his arrow [in full career] and executing the subsequent operations as already described.

[To return to the point which we left.] When once he has drawn the bow [and brought his arrow to full draw] he should hold himself as still as some bird such as a vulture or eagle - for both these birds soar in the air without any movement of the wings - until he reaches the mark.  When he draws level with the latter and his left stirrup comes a little in front of it, he should release the arrow and gracefully follow through with the appropriate thrust (*khaprah*) as he combines elegant dexterity unmarred by clumsiness with deliberate movement and a clean loose.

There are many ways of shooting an arrow from horseback. Of these, we deem seventeen to be the right number, but the rule we pass on from our master archers (*ustādin*) is that there are ten, and because the masters are agreed on these ten we take them to be primary, the rest being secondary, whose number might be increased.

To begin with, the archer may shoot downwards to the left parallel to his left thigh. This is, as we have already said, what is termed ‘shooting at the slant’, the same type of shot in an upward direction being called 'gourd-shooting'. There is a third way of shooting which lies between these two (i.e. shooting horizontally).

If the archer [charges with the intention of shooting, but] does not succeed in making his shot in the manner described, either because he has been too slow in nocking or for any other reason, he should not loose his arrow, If it is merely a matter of his overshooting the mark with his horse, he should continue in his charge, all the while spurring his mount. Having drawn the bow, he should then ease it down without loosing, for archers account a mistimed loose a fault.

The archer may turn his chest to the right and, in so doing, skilfully incline his hand to cant the upper limb of the bow, which is the top half and called the ‘shooting limb’, above the animal’s neck. By adopting the position described he can shoot an arrow that is fully effective against anyone in front of him either at short range or long. It is the horse that imposes the necessity of the procedure indicated, for should the archer shoot without canting the bow, its lower limb will strike the animal.

If he so wishes, the archer may, once the bow is drawn and the arrow at full draw, deftly bring the lower limb of his bow over the horse’s back to his right side. Then, after holding at full draw for a moment or so and resting before release, let him shoot by the shoulder of his horse.

By turning his chest to the left with a skilful and gentle twist from the waist, which should be brought round in a relaxed movement that is both graceful and effortless, and then drawing and canting his bow above the horse’s croup, the archer can shoot to his rear (i.c. from the left with his bow aslant). Should he wish to shoot to the rear, but in a manner different from that just described, he should point the top of his bow upwards, keeping its leg to the ground and slightly away from the flank of his charger so that he will not strike the animal when he releases the arrow (i.e. from the left with his bow upright).

Both methods which have been described as suitable for shooting to the rear may be used whether the target be high, as in gourd-shooting, or low, as in shooting at the slant. There are then, four kinds of shot: two for shooting at the slant and two for gourd-shooting. There is also the possibility of two other kinds of shot from the right of the horse’s croup [above the right thigh], but to shoot in this way is difficult.

Should the archer prefer another method, he may, after drawing the bow and holding at full draw in the usual way, bring his right hand up over his head and then, tucking the latter in beneath his right forearm so that his hand lodges in the hollow in the nape of his neck, shoot - (to his rear) hard by his horse’s thigh, either to right or left of it. Should he wish to adopt this technique for shooting forwards, he should, after drawing and holding, carefully bring in his bow-hand over the neck of the horse and shoot downwards in front of the right knee. This type of shooting, which can be used either on the right flank of the horse or the left, is termed *jarmaki* by archers and also admits of four kinds of shot.

If one wishes [to use this technique in another way] the bow should be turned around so that the string comes into immediate contact with the back of the left forearm outside the body. This should be done before drawing the bow. The archer's next step is to draw from behind him in the manner described after first nocking the arrow, What he does is first to place his left forearm behind the hollow in the nape of the neck between head and neck. Next, he nocks the arrow, locks, draws, and then, using the four kinds of shot already described, shoots from behind from the nape of his neck - the four kinds of shot being two to the fore of the archer and two to his rear.

Finally, the archer may shoot anyone he likes from beneath his horse’s neck, on either the right side or the left, provided he is shooting at short range. This brings us to the last of the various methods of shooting from horseback. What the archer should do here is to draw his bow with the arrow and hold. He should then twist his left arm and shoot beneath his horse's neck from one side to the other. This technique imposes upon him the necessity of discarding his horse's martingale and leaning over somewhat at an angle. [This requires long practice.]

With these two methods of shooting the number of the ten basic ways in which an arrow may be shot from horseback is complete. There is, however, no restriction upon the limit to which the forms of shooting may go, for they are governed only by men’s aspirations, by their skill in the techniques of mounted combat, by the extent of their intelligence and acumen, and by their manual dexterity, Each archer, therefore, may add to his repertoire as he wishes.

After discharging the arrow at the target in any of the aforementioned ways, the bow should be cast down from the fist on to the left forearm or upper arm. The string should be on the outside, that is to say, towards the archer's back. The left arm should be inside between the bow and the string. The bow will then be suspended on the archer's forearm and his hand left free to take up the reins again.

All the various forms of mounted archery which have been mentioned should be executed at the charge, with the horse all the while at full gallop. There should be no slackening of pace, even after the loose, until the horse reaches the end of the field. To put it plainly, the rider should continue to press his mount after casting his bow on to his forearm. The horse should finally swerve off to the left at the end of the field.

As regards procedure and rules there is no difference between gourd-shooting and shooting at the slant, for it has already been explained that the two are essentially the same, the only real difference being that in the one the direction is downward, whereas in the other it is upward. In gourd shooting the best way to shoot is for the archer to look upwards over his mount’s croup when he is just beyond the mast (*khashabah*). His best policy is to follow the arrow with his gaze until it has passed beyond (*sic*) the mark. To follow the arrow to its target applies to both types of shooting [and indeed to all types of archery].

A point to be stressed here is that when archers meet for the purpose of engaging in either of the two exercises and one of them begins to charge and start shooting, a second party should not come in behind until he is a good distance away from him so that, should the first by any chance fall, he, the second, will be able to turn his horse away to avoid coming down on top of him. Another point to remember is that the archer should not retrieve his arrow until all the shooting is over.

The field should have an even surface and, for the horse, be in fit condition underfoot. If one side of the field is higher than the other, the charge must follow the ascent. Furthermore, a crosswind blowing from one side of the field to the other is what is required. If, however, there is a direct wind, then it should be behind the archer as he makes his charge.

In gourd-shooting the archer should beware of his horse’s bumping into the mast and for this reason keep a man’s arm-span between his horse and the mast. The closer the archer is to the mast, the better and more skilful his shooting must be. Great caution must, however, be exercised in this respect because when the archer is engaged in shooting and slips his horse’s reins, his mount is liable to swerve towards the mast and collide with it with fatal results to both horse and rider. I personally have seen with my own eyes a skilful archer belonging to the company of His Excellency, the late Azdamur (Ōzdemir) the Treasurer, Viceroy of Tripoli, whose Amir of the Hunt he was, experience such a mishap on a public holiday in the city of Tripoli in Syria.  He shot at the gourd and was proclaimed by the onlookers. Then, even as he was shooting and priding himself on the crowd’s applause, he took his mind off his horse, and it collided with the mast. As a result of the accident he died that same day as also did his horse.

Everyone, therefore, who practises archery on horseback should see to it that he does not shoot from an untried horse. Indeed, his very first steps should be to try out his horse without engaging in archery. He should introduce it to the ‘gourd’ and the ‘slant’ while riding at walking pace without at any time putting it to the charge and do this several times, so that it may get to know both kinds of shooting and not take fright and shy when confronted with them. At the next stage he should put his horse to the charge as he would in actual shooting without, however, at this juncture, actually shooting. [The purpose of this is to accustom his horse to continue its gallop after the reins have been dropped from the hand.] When he finds that his horse can make a good entry and approach, displaying no faults and being sure-footed, be may thereafter shoot at his pleasure.

Should an archer wish to avoid the risk of bumping into the mast, he should stretch a rope across the field between two masts and attach the gourd to the middle of the rope. He can then charge, pursuing a completely unobstructed course under the gourd. It is a much better policy to erect two such masts rather than one, especially for novices, so as to protect them from this great hazard.

If horse-archers happen to be out in the open country and wish to practise gourd-shooting, but can obtain neither masts nor rope with which to erect the target, a circle should be marked on a stretch of flat terrain with a diameter of about 10 arm-spans (22 yards). They can then charge and, upon reaching the centre (i.e. area) of the circle, shoot up into the sky. Any arrow that comes down again in the centre of the circle can be considered accurately shot, for this circle will be the equivalent of a gourd or the same as a target. Indeed this practice calls for more precise shooting and is far less dangerous than the true method.1 I have heard it said that any archer who, upon shooting, bends his arms behind him a little will rarely miss the circle. You may also fix up a hoop on a spear like the *birjas* and shoot at that.

The field should be divided into three sections and the mark placed at the end of the second.  To achieve success and a proficient performance, the archer should begin by cantering over the first third of the field and then give the horse its head as he prepares to perform in the manner already described (or, another version: ‘So that he can nock and perform proficiently, the archer should canter from the start over the first third of the field, charge over the second, shoot at the target, and finally continue his charge to the end of the third.’), The shorter the range to be traversed by the archer, the more skilful his shooting must be. The longer the field, the easier it will be for the novice. They say that the maximum length of a field should be a distance of 130 arm-spans (about 284 yards) and the minimum 60 (about 131 yards).

For best results in shooting at the slant the archer should swing ground to his rear and shoot at the mark by the animal's left thigh. In this class of shooting, furthermore, he should override the mast by one arm-span and then shoot in the turning position.

For shooting at the slant he should also use an arrow with a slim head, such as the butt head (*amājiyyah*), and not a *yāsij* arrow (broadhead?), for the latter may sever the arrows of his colleagues (already in the target) and even do his colleagues themselves some harm. The best arrow for gourd shooting is the [small, light] cylinder type.
