# Appendix 4 - Finger-reckoning

In the Middle East and throughout the Arab world, there existed a system whereby
numbers could be indicated by the positioning, or flexures, of the fingers. The
subject is treated in some detail in J. Rushka’s ‘Arabische Texte iiber das
Fingerrechnen’, Isl, X, 1920, pp. 87-119, Arab Archery, pp. 19-23, and ER
s.v. Hisáb al-'agd.

1027The system permitted numbers to be gonveyed by the use of one hand only, where
the middle,

ing-, and little fingers were used to indicate the numbers from I to 9, and the
thumb and index finger to show the tens. From the point of view of the archer
the various locks and grasps could easily be communicated in terms of this
system. Unfortunately, as already indicated in Ch. 10, the method used by
Taybughi differs in certain details from that shown in Arab Archery and
introduces an element of confusion, mainly as regards the two most important
locks of ‘63’ and ‘69’.

1028In Arab Archery there is a detailed description of the methods of indicating
numbers from 1 to roo, which is all that concerns the archer, Figs. 56 and $7
are based on this information, modified by the assertion of Taybughi that in
indicating 9 the tips of the fingers were to beturned in to the palm. It would
follow from this that the same principle also applied to 7 and 8.

Whatever the system, the locks or grasps referred to in our text can be
reconstructed without much difficulty. We must point out, however, that in Arab
Archery, p. 21, the illustration said to indicate 20 does in fact indicate 25.
