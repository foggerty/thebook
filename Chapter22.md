# 22 - On adjustments required by different physiques

Men vary in body and structure. They are of tall stature with long arms, long neck and big chest, or of short stature with short arms and short neck. Or, they may combine different characteristics of the two extremes, Thus a tall man might have long arms and a small chest, or short arms and a big chest, and so on, according to somatic differences which it would take too long to go into. Sizes, at any rate, do vary, and, since this is so, there are different methods of shooting; for each of our predecessors in archery took up whatever lay within his own physical capacity and made no attempt to perfect that of which he was incapable. Each of them, therefore, commended whatever was within his capacity and limits of attainment and regarded it as right, at the same time condemning all else,

Most masters (*ustādin*) hold that the tall man with all the perfect characteristics of such should grasp squarely because of the length of his fingers and the size of his grasp. It is the fimest grasp.  They say that everyone with a long arm-span, long neck, and slight beard should squat obliquely (*yaq'ud mumharif*) so as to set the target in line with his left shoulder and that he should grasp squarely. What the archer does in this case is to place the main (i.e. the [mid-line of the grip’s dorsal surface]) of his bow’s grip in the middle crease of his little finger, ring-finger, and middle finger, and in the distal crease of his left index finget. He then tucks the *ibranjak* (here, evidently, ‘belly of the grip’) in to a point the width of two fingers away from his wrist-bone, at the same time tensing the bottom three fingers and relaxing the other two. The index finger is then wrapped over the back of the grip (*matn*), and the thumb placed on top of it pressing squarely against the grip. Once in this position, the tip of the thumb should be neither above nor below the level of its own base. He next locks ‘69’ and tenses the bottom three fingers of this hand, keeping the index finger outside (i.e. to the right of) the bowstring and placing the nock so that it is two-thirds of the way along the proximal phalanx of the index finger. Sighting outside the bow with both eyes together, he draws on the point where the tuft of hair grows between the lip and chin, and then right back to the lobe of the ear. "This draw is the *misah*. They say this is the method of Abū Hāshim.

It is taught that a person with short arms and fingers, short neck, big beard, big chest, and fat hands should squat facing the mark squarely and grasp obliquely. What the archer does in the case of the oblique grasp is to place the *matn* of his grip in the proximal crease [formed by the bottom three fingers] and the distal crease of the left index finger. He then tucks the *ibranjak* in to a point the width of one finger away from the wrist-bone. The rest of the procedure is as described in the case of the tall man, except that the tip of the right index finger is kept inside (i.e. to the left of) the string, the nock of the arrow resting at the bottom end of the proximal phalanx of the index finger. The archer then aims with both eyes inside the bow and draws on the cheek. This is the *bayād* because it is the opposite of that of the tall person.

Now, a tall man with long fingers grasps squarely owing to the length of his fingers and the width of his hand, in order to prevent his finger tips from touching the heel of the hand. On account of his long neck he squats obliquely, and because of the length of his right index finger he keeps it outside the bowstring. The short man, on the other hand, squats directly facing the mark because of his deep chest and short neck and grasps obliquely on account of his short fingers.  He squats in the frontal position to avoid striking his beard with the bowstring, and he draws on his cheek because of the shortness of his neck. He looses without any downward and forward thrust as he follows through because his posture as he squats directly facing the mark is not consistent with such a movement. Once his arrow is drawn, his draw is *bayād* because of the shortness of his arm-span. For Jamshid says in his book that, as regards the grip, there are three positions (*manāzil*) [for the arrowhead]: the lesser, the greater, and the injurious (*bidāyah, nihāyah, mikāyah*, respectively; literally ‘initial, final and injurious points’). His maxim is, ‘Give the tall man the lesser, which is the draw at its shortest (awwal wafā), or 'wiping the fist' (misāh i-qabdah). Give the short man the greater, which is the *bayād*, or ultimate (tāmm). He allows the latter to let his elbow sink down. This is the method of Tāhir al-Balkhi.

The archer of medium build adopts an intermediate squatting position between the oblique and frontal so that he has the target in line with his collar-bone. He also adopts a grasp that lies between the oblique and the square. What he does is to place the *matn* of the grip in the middle of the proximal phalanges half-way between the middle and proximal creases. The *ibranjak* of his grip he places at a distance from the wrist-bone that would amount to the width of one and a half fingers. When nocking, he locks ‘69’ on nock and string and allows the bowstring to bisect the end of the right index finger. He sights with the right eye inside the bow and the left outside, and then draws on his mouth right to the lobe of his ear, the draw in this case being termed *misāh bayād*. He follows through with a forward and downward thrust of the bow-hand and twists with the other, but in both cases executes only half the full movement. This, then, is the intermediate method, which is that of Ishaq ar-Raffa’.

Masters of olden times are quoted as saying that a master (*ustād*) cannot be such until he can lengthen the short and shorten the long. Shortening the long (*taqsir at-qasī*) means that the archer grasps squarely and, by so doing, shortens his fingers in such a way that their tips do not reach the heel of the hand. Lengthening the short (*tatwil al-qasīr*) means that he grasps obliquely and so lengthens his fingers to go round the grip in the appropriate manner. They likewise taught that the farthest point to which an archer should reach when drawing should be the point at which the distal phalanx of his right index finger comes to rest beneath the lobe of his right ear. When he looses and, bringing his right hand into operation, opens the right index finger, its nail should come to rest beneath the lobe of his ear. This goes for tall, short, and medium persons alike.

A person with a short neck should squat in the frontal position. The same applies to a person with a protrusive chest and, again, to a person with a big beard. Every person with any single one of these characteristics should face the mark directly whether squatting, standing, or riding. A person with a long neck, high, unprotrusive chest and small beard should squat obliquely.  The oblique position also applies to standing and riding. If a man's fingers are short and his palm is long, he should square his palm and slant his fingers. If, on the other hand, his fingers are long and his palm is short, the palm should be slanted and his fingers squared.

There are also three positions (*manāzil*) on which to draw. The tall man should draw on the tuft of hair between his lower lip and chin, the short man on his cheek, and the man of medium build on his mouth. It has been explained that the limit to which the draw should be taken is marked by the lower extremity of the ear, which means to say that when one looses, the nail of the right index finger should lie beneath the lobe of the ear. This is the soundest pronouncement on the subject and a much-needed piece of advice which men will do well to heed, particularly those who are serious practitioners of the art and are called 'master'.

Now, it is my humble opinion that since archery came into existence its essential purpose has been to inflict injury upon one's enemy, and the greater the power and strength of the bow and the longer the arrow, the greater the injury inflicted. It is our opinion then that if the archer takes up an oblique position (*inharafa*) with the mark in line with his left shoulder, he will develop more powerful traction since the joints of the left arm can be locked more or less in a straight line in the same horizontal plane with each bone supporting the other. The forearm will then be firm enough to take the weight of the bow, and it will accordingly attain its maximum power. Furthermore, if the draw is [correctly] executed from this position, a longer arrow can be used. To recapitulate: for the reasons we have explained the archer who uses this technique will not only shoot more powerfully than an opponent who does not, provided, of course, that both persons are equally strong, but he will also draw a longer arrow which will be more effective against an enemy adopting a different method.

The archer who, on the other hand, faces the mark directly—by which is meant one who puts his face squarely to the mark—will experience impairment of traction because when he comes to draw, he will bend his left arm in front of his face. His arm, therefore, will turn and come in upon itself and, in so doing, weaken, thereby impairing his traction and leaving him no alternative but to draw a short arrow. The result of all this will be a reduction of his effectiveness. An archer should, then, shoot according to the first technique if he can do so. The reason for this lies not only in the factors we have already mentioned as affecting the strength end power of the bow and the length of the arrow, but also in the fact that a combatant enters the fray with his left side [because it enables him to shoot the enemy from under his shield without exposing himself to the foe]. This way of shooting, however, can be difficult, and, in fact, cannot be practised by persons with certain physical characteristics. This is especially true in the case of a man with a protrusive chest, short neck or big beard, for such a person must, as we have said, face the mark directly. I myself have heard some archers condemn the technique and thoroughly disapprove of it on aesthetic grounds, saying that it is the Persian manner of shooting. But to condemn it is very much a mistake on their part because the main object is not an elegant appearance but the effectiveness of the weapon in repelling the enemy.

The intermediate method gives much the same degree of effectiveness as the oblique and is universally acceptable. The rule for its adherents will, then, be the intermediate, which conforms to the Apostle Muhammad's dictum: ‘In all things the best policy is the happy medium.’

It is my opinion that any man whose limbs are in due proportion, whose neck is long and supple, and whose chest is not protrusive, can exercise greater freedom of movement and action in shooting than anyone else, The closer he is to obliqueness, the stronger the bow he can draw and the longer the arrow. Any man with disproportionate members, no matter who he is, will fall short of perfection according to the measure of his disproportions. Exactly the same thing applies in the case of enterprise and intellectual capacity, both of which must be commensurate with physical potential. For a man of limited enterprise cannot equal a highly enterprising and intelligent individual. On the contrary, in nothing will he come anywhere near him, even though his members may perhaps be what they should.

Weapons of war must be exactly suited to the members of those who use them. Since this is so, the principle is all the more right and proper when applicable to the bow because of its proven superiority over all other weapons; for it is even as the Prophet said when bows were mentioned in his exalted presence, ‘No weapon has ever done better (sc. for the cause of Islam) than the bow.’ Any man of intelligence and experience, then, should have a bow to suit his limbs, as advised in our poem, and the same applies to the arrow. If, for some reason, he cannot attain perfection he should endeavour to get as near to it as possible. Since a man cannot change the way in which human limbs are created, he should turn his attention to adapting his weapons to the requirements of the limbs which he has, because anything that is man-made can easily be altered. To have an archer adjust his weapons to suit his limbs is a more sensible and easier policy than to tax him beyond the capacity of his members. If a man has a large palm and long fingers, we tell him to grasp squarely to enable him to grip properly. If his fingers are too long, we tell him to thicken the grip of his bow either by a fundamental structural alteration or by affixing a piece of leather as indicated earlier. This is a more sensible course than to assume the difficult task of changing his narural grasp because of the slenderness of a bow's grip, which can be altered and adjusted, or even be entirely rebuilt. This is the easier and more profitable policy. A man with a small hand can be advised to adopt the reverse procedure. We tell him to grasp obliquely, and if his fingers are short, we tell him to narrow the grip of his bow. To enable a man with a long and supple neck to sight correctly, we tell him to sight outside the bow and gauge in that position. We need press the point no further since we have already said enough to enable a man of sound understanding and good common sense to grasp our meaning.
