# 21- On the fault and injuries to which archers are exposed

Injuries sustained by archers fall into five groups:
* Rapping [of parts of the body with the bowstring] (*tarq*);
* Blistering ('*aqr*);
* Splitting [of skin and nails] (*shaqq*);
* Tremor (*irti āsh*);
* Blue bruising (*zurqah*).

*Rapping* occurs in *eight* places:
1. The wrist (left);
2. The upper arm (left);
3. The shoulder (left);
4. The cheek (right);
5. The chin;
6. The nipple (left);
7. 'The end of the right index finger;
8. The tip of the thumb (right).

*Blistering* occurs in *five* places:
1. The fingers of the bow-hand;
2. The arrow-guide "formed by the thumb’;
3. The distal phalanx of the thumb (right);
4. The [lower] half of the distal phalanx of the right index finger;
5. The base of the right index finger (i.e. just in front of the knuckle-joint).

*Splitting* occurs in *four* places:
1. Between the thumb and index finger of the left hand;
2. In the proximal phalanx of the thumb (left);
3. Down the thumb-nail (right);
4. Across the thumb-nail (right).

*Blue bruising* occurs in *three* places:
1. The tip of the right index finger;
2. The pad (*kulwah*) of the right thumb;
3. Under the nail of the right index finger, the size of a lentil.

*Tremor* occurs in *four* places:
1. The right arm;
2. The left arm;
3. The entire body;
4. The head.

*Rapping of the [left] wrist* results from *eight* causes:
1. Slackness of the grip-fingers;
2. Slackness of the wrist;
3. Protrusion of the shoulder;
4. The internal draw;
5. Too long a bowstring;
6. Squatting obliquely in the case of an archer with a deep chest;
7. Too long an arrow;
8. Too strong a bow.

*Six faults and mishaps* result from all this:
1. Wagging of the arrow in flight;
2. Diminished accuracy;
3. Reduced effectiveness;
4. Loss of range;
5. A snapped bowstring;
6. A cut sleeve.

*Rapping of the [left] upper arm* arises from *five* errors:
1. Inversion of the cupping-point (*inqilab al-fisād*);
2. The internal draw;
3. Squatting obliquely;
4. Lifting the shoulders.

*Four faults* can result from this:
1. Low flight (*taswib as-sahm*);
2. Diminished accuracy;
3. Loss of range;
4. Reduced effectiveness.

*Rapping of the [left] shoulder* arises from *four* causes:
1. Overdrawing (by misjudgement where the archer’s arrow is too long for his bow);
2. Protrusion of the shoulder;
3. Excessive obliqueness in posture;
4. Too strong a bow.

*Six* results follow from this:
1. Low flight;
2. A cut sleeve;
3. Slapping of the arrow-pass [with consequent deflection] (*tadmik*);
4. A broken shaft;
5. A wagging arrow;
6. Diminished accuracy.

*Rapping of the right check* arises from *three* errors:

1. Bending the neck sideways;
2. Overdrawing (in the sense indicated above);
3. Squatting obliquely in the case of an archer with a short neck; for when such a person adopts this position and draws, he inclines his head, and the bowstring strikes his cheek, especially if he has a scanty beard. A short-necked person should not, therefore, sit obliquely. A squatting position directly facing the mark is the only position suitable for such a person.

*Rapping of the chin/beard* arises from *six* errors:
1. Squatting obliquely in the case of an archer with a short neck;
2. The internal draw;
3. Too long an arrow;
4. Tensing the neck;
5. Tensing the waist;
6. Too strong a bow.

*Rapping of the nipple* arises from *four* causes:
1. Squatting obliquely;
2, The internal draw!;
3. Close proximity of the bowstring to the chest;
4. Excessive dropping of the [right] elbow.

*Rapping of the right index finger* arises from *two* causes:
1. Tensing it on the thumb at the draw;
2. Its being slack at the loose. Any person with long fingers should keep his right finger away from the bowstring (i.e. to the right of it).

*Rapping of the thumb* arises from *two* faults:
1. The tip of the thumb being held limply on the middle phalanx of the middie finger at the draw;
2. A sluggish loose.

*Blistering of the fingers of the left hand* arises from *four* causes:
1. Slackness of the grip-fingers;
2. Too thin a grip;
3. Grasping incorrectly;
4. The flesh on the palm gathering up under [pressure from] the belly and the *matn*; for when one looses and follows through with a forward and downward thrust and the grip pinches the flesh of one’s fingers, it results in diminished accuracy, reduced effectiveness, and loss of range.

*Blistering of that part of the thumb which guides the arrow (majrā)* arises from eight errors:
1. Pinching the nock (*khanq al-kāz*) and pressing too heavily on the nockpiece (*kabb ‘alā l-fūq*);
2. Downward displacement of the nocking-point;
3. Drawing upwards and loosing downwards;
4. Too wide a nock;
5. Too narrow a nock;
6. Too square a grasp (so that the wrist is brought too far round to the right) and tension of the thumb;
7. Predominance, and consequent distortion, of the leg of the bow (because of its greater strength);
8. A crooked arrow.

*Splits across the thumb-nail* arise from *four* causes:
1. Having the thumb slack when drawing, and fastening the right index finger over its tip;
2. The tip of the thumb being off the middle finger;
3. Locking with the tip;
4. Releasing the thumb before the right index finger. This fault can be eliminated by loosing with the right index finger without opening the thumb [until afterwards?].

*Splits down the nail* arise from *five* causes:
1. Opening the little finger;
2. Having nothing under the thumb to hold it in check;
3. Freeing the bowstring under the distal phalanx of the thumb;
4. Fastening the tip of the right index finger on the thumb;
5. Twisting the side of the thumb upwards, thus causing wear and tear on the side of the nail with resultant splitting. The fault may be corrected by tensing the three appropriate fingers, placing the tip of the thumb on the middle phalanx of the middle finger where it should be held straight and tense, relaxing the right index finger, and releasing with the latter before the thumb.

*Blue bruising of the pad of the thumb* arises from *two* causes:
1. Its being rapped by the bowstring;
2. Its being left too free.

*Blue bruising of the tip of the right index finger* arises from the following cause:
1. Loosing with the finger bent with the result that it is caught by the string when loosed, This fault can be eliminated by keeping the index finger outside (Le. to the right of) the bowstring when locking.

*Blue bruising under the nail* arises from *four* causes:
1. Shortness of the fingers;
2, A relaxed thumb on the middle finger;
3. Putting only the very tip (ratrif) of the index finger on the thumb;
4. Tensing the index finger over the tip of the thumb.

*Tremor* arises from *two* causes:
1. Relaxation of the elbows and shoulder-blades;
2. Tension in the neck.

The elimination of all these faults and their attendant ills can be achieved by the application of reverse procedures. Thus, if tension in any part of the body is the cause of the trouble, relaxation is the remedy, and if relaxation is the cause, tension is the cure. If an oblique squatting position (*qu'ūd at-tahrif*) is the cause, the mark should be faced directly. If too strong a bow is the cause, the archer must shoot a bow to match his capacity, and if an arrow is too long for him, he should draw only as much of it as his limbs will take, and so on.

There is no mystery about this sort of thing, and so, for the sake of brevity, we have not always indicated the remedy for cach fault as it has arisen. All an archer need do is to follow faithfully the advice contained in our poem since it incorporates all the good advice he needs, and those who turn to it for guidance and put its counsels into practice will acquire nothing but good habits and immunity from the faults and injuries mentioned above. I have in fact only dealt with the subject by way of supplementing my commentary.
