907 COMMENT 1. Awkward Shots


Shooting from ground level at an enemy in a well is much the same as engaging a target in a comparable position from the top of a fortress. That the archer found himself more frequently in the second of the situations visualized by the author, we need hardly doubt. The need to shoot at a target immediately beneath the walls of a fortress could arise at any time during a siege, and fortresses were normally designed in such a way that archers could engage anyone at the foot of the walls from projecting towers. Where blind spots existed, however, the method indicated in the text—an extension of the jarmaki technique (p. 82)—could obviously be applied to great effect. To shoot a bow directly downwards and retain one’s balance by any other normal means is almost impossible. a

908In circumstances such as those visualized it would, one may think, be easier to drop a rock or the like on one’s foe, but it must be remembered that while many a warrior would have his bow with him and be in a position to take immediate action, he might lose precious moments in finding or handling a suitable stone.

909 2. Grouping of Arrows


In the literature and legends of many countries there are stories of almost incredible shots achieved by archers, and in modern times some remarkable shots have indeed been made. Such feats, however, may be regarded as isolated cases representing the perfect shot out of many thousands made. In our text, on the other hand, we have a rare and important guide to the stan- dard of accuracy expected of every archer. He is required to group his arrows within a circle roughly 3 feet in diameter at 75 yards. The ability to do this with wooden shafts and without the aid of a sighting device such as can be fitted to a bow by the modern archer demands a very high standard of accuracy and bespeaks a well-trained and experienced bowman. It is neverthe- Jess within the reach of anyone who will practise with diligence.

910 3. The ‘Short URP


In the absence of any explanation of the ‘short ulk?’ it is essential first to determine the meaning of the noun. Registered by Dozy in his Supplément (s.v.), ulkt is defined there as ‘a kind of military exercise’. The definition could, and should, have been a little more precise, for Reinaud—Dozy’s authorky—although unable to determine the exact nature of what he took to be some form of military exercise, clearly appreciated that the word was connected with archery and leaves the impression that he thought it had to do with a target of some kind or other (op. cit., p. 221).  That Reinaud was not far from the truth we can now confirm from the evidence of a passage in MSS of the C group in which we read: ‘. . . the full target (al-hadaf at-tamám) which is called the ulli in Turkish and is known as the long field (al-maydan at-tawil) has a length of between 130 and 140 arm-spans, though it may sometimes be less . . ? (CA, 146a; C*, 213b; C?, 722). The ulki, then, was a target at a range of something in the order of 284-306 yards and possibly 284- 328 yards, since the ‘long field’ with which it is said to have been synonymous is given elsewhere as between 130 and 150 arm-spans (C', 29a; C$, 50a; C3, 21b; cf. D!, 21a; D4, 502). It is almost certainly to be identified with the Turkish ülkü (‘target, goal’) which has been revived in the modern language in the sense of ‘an ideal, something to aim at’ (see Moran, Turkish-English Dictionary, S.v.).

911The ‘short wiki’ must obviously have been a target at short range. How short it actually was we cannot say for certain, but, as we shall presently see, it could reasonably be considered to have been somewhere in the region of 75 yards.


4. Trajectory

912 The sections concerned with the height attained by an arrow on its way to the target and the time it should take to reach it are closely related and reflect a basically sound scientific approach to an important problem, however elementary the recommended methods of solving it may be.

In hunting or war a low trajectory is an advantage as the archer is less likely to miss the target through an error in his estimation of range. Should he overestimate his range, but shoot a fast and therefore low arrow, it would be very likely to hit the target striking high, whereas with the same degree of error a slow arrow describing a more pronounced curve would miss by passing over its target. Conversely, if its range is underestimated, a fast arrow may well hit low, while a slow one will strike the ground short of the target. A second advantage of the fast arrow over the slow is that the archer, when shooting at a moving target, can decrease the distance by which he needs to aim ahead of the mark. The less he has to anticipate his target, the more likely he is to hit, A shorter time of flight offers the additional advantage of diminishing the effect of any wind that may be present.

913With a given bow, the heavier the arrow, the slower the flight, but the harder the striking power

914 by reason of its weight. A light arrow will fly faster and lower, but lack of weight may prevent effective penctration of armour or mail.

The method of assessing velocity by shooting under a rope stretched across the middle of the range is an important point which we have subjected to careful scrutiny. Unfortunately the range of the target is vague since we do not know for certain what meaning ‘short uik? had for Taybugha, but if it could be assumed to convey the same distance as that recommended for the dexterity and grouping tests (75 yds.), the resulting calculations are technically interesting.

915There are a number of unknown factors, but if we start with a shaft of the standard length, a probable path of the arrow through the air can be predicted with reasonable accuracy (Klopsteg, Archery : The Technical Side, pp. 122-27 and 236-45). The height of the rope across the centre of the range would be about 8 feet (though we must allow for a margin on either side because the measurement is based on human stature which is variable). Given the data suggested, it will be found that a man, kneeling or squatting, must discharge his arrow at not less than 180 f.p.s. if it is to hit a target on the ground at 75 yards with a trajectory not excecding 8 feet in height. The time of flight would be about 1} seconds. This standard represents a minimum requirement, and adherence to it would ensure that bows of adequate power were used by archers for warfare. To us this seems the most practical explanation of the ‘short uit’ test. The method would certainly afford a more accurate means of assessing flight than what amounts to a rough and ready calcula- tion of time by counting between loose and hit.


5. Dexterity and Rate of Shooting

916 In terms intelligible to the modern reader the standard of rapidity the author sets for the archer is the ability to discharge 3 arrows in about 1j seconds. This is a fast time, and one’s first reaction is surprise that such a high standard, which few, if any, Western bowmen of today could attain, should be expected of the general run of Mameluke archers. It is nevertheless an attainable standard as is evident from the achievement, in modern times, of Saxton Pope who did succeed on a number of occasions in shooting 7 arrows in 8 seconds (Elmer, Target Archery, Pp. 428-30).

Accuracy naturally diminishes with increased speed, and field trials suggest that it is difficult to exceed 8 well-aimed shots per minute, Nevertheless, it cannot be doubted that Muslim archers could shoot at high speed and, given a large enough target, hit with all shots. During the Second Crusade William of Tyre, who must haye been conversant with the performance of his own bowmen, remarked more than once on the dexterity of the enemy archers. ‘The Saracen cavalry ... began to shoot thicker and faster than one could believe possible’ is a fairly typical comment of the period (Smail, Crusading Warfare, pp. 76-77 and nn. 8, 9).

917In contemporary military science the rate of projection of missiles, when multiplied by their weight or explosive force, gives what is termed ‘fire-power’. If we may be excused an anachronistic and, in the context an admittedly incongruous, use of words for a nevertheless legitimate purpose, the fire-power of a crossbow shooting 2 x 800 gr. missiles per min. would be 1,600 gr. per min.  and might be compared with that of a hand bow shooting 8 x 400 gr., or 3,200 gr., per min.  Fire-power combined with mobility is a point upon which modern military teaching lays great stress, and it is this combination that undoubtedly contributed to the effectiveness of Muslim horse-archers in their heyday.

That 3 arrows could in fact be regularly shot in about 1} seconds we do not question; we only regret that we are not told exactly how the arrows should be held in order to shoot with such alacrity.

9186. Razor-arrows


In a medieval battle vast number of arrows would be shot, and archers naturally gathered all they could during a lull in readiness for further action. To deny the enemy the use of one’s own

919 MISCELLANEOUS TECHNIQUES AND DEVICES 143


arrows while maintaining the ability to use those shot by him commends itself as a military tactic.

920The effectiveness of the razor-arrow may be questioned since the average archer might reasonably be expected to examine any arrow he had picked up in order to ensure that it was sound before storing it in his quiver. Nevertheless, it is easy to visualize the odd occasion when such a device might be effective. For instance, an archer desperate for arrows in the heat of battle and harassed by some marksman from whom he could not allow his eyes to stray for more than a fleeting moment might be put out of action with a razor-arrow snatched up in haste.


7. Nockless Arrows

921 In trials we have experienced some difficulty in retaining the nockless arrow firmly in the tube attached to the bowstring. With practice it might be possible to develop a surer hold. At all events, this kind of arrow commends itself as a more effective stratagem than the razor-arrow.

In Arab Archery (p. 133) we find mention of the ring fitted to the bowstring to take the tapered tail of an arrow, but nothing is said of either the julbah or the razor device. On the other hand, mention is made of another contrivance known as the birn. This was a ring loosely fitted to the string with a nail-like projection designed for insertion into a hole previously drilled into the tail of a nockless arrow, by which means it could then be shot.

922 8. Incendiaries


In his treatment of the pellets and the egg the author has such difficulty with his Arabic that he fails to make himself completely clear, and the first few lines of the text admit of more than one interpretation. In our judgement, the idea he is trying to convey is that red- or white- hot pellets may be used alone, but that they are more effective if used in conjunction with some inflammable material. He then goes on to illustrate how this can best be done, By means of the fannel-shaped device that he describes, the narrow end of which evidently fitted over the fore- shaft of an arrow, the heated pellet and incendiary egg could be transformed into a blazing projectile when shot. The insertion of the pellet must, it seems to us, have preceded the insertion of the egg, the latter fitting into the bigger end. Hence our proposed emendation of the text. For this form of arson the archer would require the assistance of a loader.

923We have found no reference other than that in our text to the firing of bales of cotton at either of the sieges of Acre. Which siege is intended is not specified, but we surmise that it is the second in 1291 in which Baybars al-Bunduqdari deployed several hundred catapults and made extensive use of incendiary missiles. Since the Arabic text is corrupt and can be restored in two slightly different ways, it is difficult to decide whether the purpose of the bales was to stop a breach or to protect part of a wall or to barricade and reinforce. Certainly in medieval times a section of wall which showed signs of weakening under continued bombardment by catapults would often be padded with suitable material, such as cotton bales, which, hung from the battle- ments, helped to deaden the effect of the missiles. As this was a normal procedure on the part of defenders, the Crusaders may well have acted in this way at Acre even if the fact is not mentioned by contemporary historians. It is equally reasonable to assume that the bow, using the means described, provided a simple and practical method of destroying this improvised protection.

In history, bows have regularly been used to project incendiaries, One method of doing this was to shoot an inflammable liquid at the target which could be ignited when struck by a white- hot arrowhead, Another was to launch a shaft carrying a burning substance lit before shooting.  Once a fire had been started, of course, its intensity could be increased by projecting more fuel into the flames. It is obvious that in siege warfare engines capable of hurling relatively large quantities of combustible material would be far more effective than bows. On the other hand, to deploy catapults for action would take time, and, where a quick attack aided by conflagration

might carry the enemy’s defences, the bow would commend itself as the more suitable instrument.  Surprisingly, perhaps, Taybugha does not make the point, nor does he take the matter of incendiaries any further.

925The whole problem of incendiary material has been discussed at length by J. R. Partington in his History of Greek Fire and Gunpowder (Cambridge, 1960). In Ch. V he covers those used in Muslim lands, including those offered by Mardi at-Tarsiisi (cf. Cahen, BEO, XII, pp. 145ff.).  The various recommendations include a mixture suitable for projection in an egg-shell and compounded of sandarac, ‘water of sulphur, that is, naphtha’ and colophonium (p. 198). (“Water of sulphur would appear to have been a distilled petroleum.)

For incendiary arrows sulphur and resins mixed with some binding agent such as pulverized straw formed a substance that could be lit and shot at a target. One device mentioned in Arab Archery, p. 134, is a spindle-shaped arrowhead made of a number of tubes which united at their ends to form a hollow head resembling women's spindles. The shaft fitted into a cylindrical projection, and the head could be filled with straw and cotton saturated with tar. A more fanciful recipe consisted of otter fat, black sulphur, bdellium gum, pith of fresh cherry seeds, and quick- lime, all of which were ground and kneaded with pure oil of balsam. For further details on the incendiary arrow throughout the ages the reader will find it useful to consult ‘The Incendiary Arrow, 480 B.C. to A.D. 1941’, (symposium), JSAA, vol. 3, 1960, p pp. 22-24.

926Such short tests as we have been able to carry out on mixtures recommended in medieval sii a — that, although they burn steadily when lit, it is difficult to prevent them from blowing out en shot.
