## 6 - On thumb-guards

*Kushtumān* (‘thumb-guard’) is an arabicized form of a word borrowed from the Persian. In Persian the term is *angushtvan* ('finger-protector') and in old Arabic *jati ah* or, it is said, *khati ah*

There are many kinds of thumb-guard to suit individual tastes and purposes, Experience attests the value of that which is of a single layer of leather without either padding or lip (*saysarah*}, but it demands a great deal of practice for the archer to be able to retain the string (with a steady hold). For this reason a lip has been added, and [now in its modified form this type] is the most useful and convenient thumb-guard for all archers. Those who have long thumbs should see that the lip is thick, while those with short thumbs should keep it thin. This kind of guard will show up faults in locking, and for this reason thumb-guards of bone and horn are often used. This type, however, even though it can conceal an archer’s faults, may well break when most needed and thus put a man out of action. Some guards are therefore made of gold or silver. There are people, such as the Turkmens, who use a plain circular band as a thumb-guard so that it can be kept on their hands at all times like an ordinary silver signet ring. This is an excellent type for persons who have to endure the hazards of expeditionary operations. Some people even shoot without any thumb-guard at all, and by dint of intense practice they become accustomed to so doing. There is no greater asset than the ability to shoot in this way if one is so endowed.

The golden rule for a thumb-guard is that it should be exactly the size of the thumb, neither bigger nor smaller. According to Tahir, the use of a thick lip will increase cast (*atrad li-s-sahm*; in other words, be better for distance), but greater accuracy will be attained (e.g. in target shooting) by the use of a thin one. The best policy is to adhere to that to which one is accustomed.  If one has no particular habit in this respect, then it is better to follow the instructions which we have given above.
