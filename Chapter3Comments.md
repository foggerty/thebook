### 1. Old Arab Bows

(a) *Bows of the Hejaz*. According to our understanding of the text, three basic kinds of bow were used by the Arabs of the Hejaz: (i) that made of a single stave; (ii) that made of two staves joined together; (iii) that backed with sinew and lined with horn. From some remote period the Beduins, or nomads, had used the first two kinds, while the sedentary population had developed the third. According to Arab Archery, pp. 10-11, (i) could either be a self bow or consist of a single stave split lengthwise, in which case it bore the name *filq*, while (ii) consisted of two staves so split and was termed sharfj. (The technical implications of this information are dis- cussed in some detail by Faris and Elmer, ibid., p. 11, n. 5 and p. 158.) As regards (iii), there is no meation of its being a weapon of the sedentary Hejazis; it is said without further explanation that it was used 'only by experts or those who lived near water'. It is described as backed, or bound, with sinew (*mu'aqqabah* - inaccurately translated by Faris Elmer as 'reinforced'). The one really important point made in *Arab Archery* is that all these Hejazi bows were basically a stave of wood shaved down.

(b) The *wāsitiyyah*. In *Arab Archery* this is said to have been the composite bow (*masnū ah, murakkabah*). One source quoted by Hein speaks of it as the 'Hejazi intermediate’ (*al-Hijāziyyah al-wāsitiyyah*). There can be little doubt that it was the Arabian composite bow (cf, Arab Archery, pp. 11-12), but whereas all sources which we have been able to consult agree that the bow was not, as might be supposed, so called after the city of Wāsit (on the Tigris between Baghdad and the Gulf), none of them explains in which respect the bow occupied an intermediate position. After careful consideration we suggest that it was intermediate, not from the point of view of size, but from the point of view of construction and relative proportion of its components, having perhaps more wood, but Iess horn and sinew, than such composites as the Persian or Turkish. The difference would be immediately obvious in cross-section. (A variety of cross-sections of composite bows may be seen in the Pitt Rivers Museum, Oxford.)

The question of old Arab bows, of which our author had probably little, if any, first-hand knowledge, is a subject requiring investigation in its own right since there is a good deal of conflicting information in our sources — one of the most important is Ibn Sidah’s *Mukhassas* which cannot be considered here. Taybughā's interest is the composite bow of his time and area, which can scarcely have been of Arabian provenance. He so takes the composite for granted that nowhere in his work does he ever trouble to apply the epithet to a bow, and there is much to suggest that his knowledge of the more primitive bows which he mentions, quite obviously by way of historical introduction and from a desire to link the bow with the Prophet’s native Hejax, is second-hand,

### Construction of a Composite Bow

From the foregoing chapter and the sources of information indicated at the end of this section a picture can be developed of many of the details of the construction and form of the bow described by our author.

The design of composite bows varied with time, place, climate, and the purposes for which they were intended (war, hunting, flight shooting, etc.), but the basic method of construction was the same throughout the East.

The first component to be worked was the wooden core, which to a large extent determined the final form of the bow and served as the foundation to which the horn and sinew were later glued, This frame on which the bow was built was made in three basic parts:

(i) The grip, or handle. This had to be relatively thick and rigid. A bow that bends in the hand upon drawing is normally unpleasant to use, as it kicks when shot and is, on that account, usually inaccurate. The thickness of the grip was determined by its need to fit the hand.

(ii) The *dustārs*. These were the two working parts of the limbs which took all the bend. The wood in these sections could either be flat or slightly oval in shape and about one-eighth of an inch thick along the centre line. The side to which the horn would later be attached was, as a rule, coarsely scored to increase the surface area exposed to the glue.

(ii) The *siyahs*. Working outwards from the grip, we find continuous with each end of the dustars the ridged portion of the siyah. Here the wood was curved towards the tip and shaped to give, in cross-section, a shallow triangle which gave the structural rigidity required in the end of the bow. The width of the siyah tapers sharply into the tip, or ear. Initially the ears were longer than in their final form, with temporary nocks cut into the 'wrong' side to aid manufacture (below Fig. 242).

In details the construction of the wooden core varied according to the desired final shape of the bow and the quality and characteristics of the wood available to the craftsman. While we cannot be too dogmatic about these details, we may say that in Turkish bows the grip was commonly fashioned from one piece of wood, while both dustdr and siyah were formed, without join, from another. In the Persian design, on the other hand, we find the grip, dustdr, and siyah made from three different pieces of wood, and this method is sometimes encountered in Turkish bows. Sino-Tatar bows almost invariably have a long unbroken strip of bamboo for both dustárs and the grip. The latter has an additional piece of wood, or riser, glued to the back to give the required thickness. The most complex are the types from central Southern India, in which grip, dustár, the ridged section. of the siyah, and the tip, or ear, were each made from different lengths of wood, thus giving seven separate pieces for the construction of the core.

This brief account will give a rough idea of the more common variations that can be found in existing bows. Other examples of construction could be cited, but it is not our purpose to penetrate too far into this field.

The various sections of the composite bow were united by means of single fish-tail, or V- form, splices and glued together. At the junctions between the grip and the *dustārs*, and the *dustārs* and the *siyahs*, the abutting surfaces of the wood were smoothly tapered in depth so that each section merged into the other, thus making it difficult to detect the end of one section and the beginning of the next in the finished article. In bows that have been stripped down dissection has revealed such joints extending over a length of about 3 1/2 in. Hence, although the actual grip might only be 5 in. long, the piece of wood on which it was built could be about 12 in. in length from point to point of the two 'V's to which it was tapered for fitting into the fish-tails cut in the *dustārs* (Fig. 7). Some splices exceed 5 in. in length, but a measurement of this order is unusual,

In *Arab Archery*, pp. 11-12, it is clearly indicated that the wooden core was to be in five sections, viz. the grip, the two *dustārs*, and the two *siyahs*.

The width of all known composite bows increases at the place where the knots at the ends of the bowstring are intended to rest, the purpose being to avoid any risk of the string's slipping around the *siyah*, thereby causing the bow to capsize. Too long a string, for instance, might well slip in this way and cause the bow to spring violently back into its unbraced position. Such an occurrence would shock both bow and archer and could easily do serious harm to one or both. It was essential, therefore, that that part of the bowstring which ran from knot to knot of the end loops should not touch the siyah. If the design of the bow required siyaks so shaped as to predispose to this hazard, string-bridges were often fitted to support the loop-knots at the points where they would normally rest. Those from the Middle East were usually of bone, ivory, or horn. Disc-shaped and measuring about ¾ in. in diameter, they were scooped or hollowed in such a way that the sides rose towards the outer edges of the bow to form small cradles for the loop-knots (Fig. 10). Since no mention of such a fitting has been found in any MS that we have examined, the recurve of the tips of the braced bow would seem to have been such that this device was not needed.

The dimensions of what our author considered to be the best of Syrian Mameluke bows are clearly given in the text as well as the length of the string it required. The only point open to doubt is the bracing height, i.e. the distance between the grip and the string of the braced bow, Given the length of the various components, the bracing height would determine, inter alia, the angle through which the siyah was curved. A reconstruction is shown in Plate 18.

The craftsman, then, shaped and assembled the components of the wooden core. Having regard to the rigidity required in the grip and *siyahs*, on the one hand, and to the flexibility demanded of the *dustārs*, on the other, he could use different woods for different sections. Our author indicates that work on the core was carried out in the autumn, a time of the year when the cooler weather and higher humidity would retard the setting-rate of the glue and give adhesion superior to that obtainable in the hot, dry summer.

While the glue was setting, the horn strips with which the belly would be lined could be sawn and prepared, Water-buffalo and certain types of goat and antelope could provide suitable material for the purpose. Since the horn of European cattle tends to split into thin layers when subjected to stress, it would not meet the needs of the Oriental composite bow. In dissected bows the horn has been found to taper in thickness from between 1/2 in. and 1/4 in. at the grip to half the amount at the centre of the dustár. Continuing to taper, it ends a little way past the joint between the siyah and the *dusrār*, The thickness depends to some extent on the proposed weight of the finished bow.

Next, the horn was glued to the belly of the core, To ensure maximum adhesion, the two surfaces were usually scored to increase the surface area exposed to the glue. The horn was firmly bound to the core, care being taken not to press out too much of the glue in the process. The reflex of the bow was controlled by a cord tied between the two tips, and at this stage it was held in the form of a shallow ‘C’ (Fig. 9). For the glue to dry thoroughly about three months would be needed, after which sinew could be applied in warmer weather. Warmth would be essential, for on a cold day sinew is very difficult to handle and, if affixed under such conditions, would almost certainly make for a poor bow. Hence the stipulation in our text that work of this kind should be undertaken in spring.

Some modern European authors, notably Payne-Gallwey (*The Turkish Composite Bow*, p. 4), have stated that the sinew was prepared from neck tendon, but we have proved by experiment that this is useless for two reasons. Firstly, it is far too elastic for the purpose for which it is intended and, secondly, it will not beat out into the fibrous form in which it needs to be applied, but will break up into small pieces. (It can, however, be used when cut into short lengths to build up the triangular section of the siyah, and we know of instances in which it has been employed for this purpose.) Leg tendon, on the other hand—preferably that of deer according to the findings of Dr. G. Fabian of Godolo, Hungary—is a suitable material It can be dried, beaten out into fibres, and then impregnated with glue for combing into a layer along the back of the bow.  It is important, however, to ensure that the temperature of the glue is not so high as to destroy its elasticity, which is sensitive to heat.

Having reached this stage, the bow was reflexed into a complete oval, and the tips were tied together, a cord being led from the latter around the grip to control the degree of bend (Plate 2).  The sinew was thickly applied over the ridged portion of the siyah, leaving it, in section, almost an equilateral ‘triangle with increased rigidity. Of all the components in the composite bow, the backing of sinew was the most important, and by correct application of the material a skilful craftsman could compensate for defects both in horn and wood. It was applied in one, two, or even three layers, but the full reflex was only achieved after completion of the final layer.  Experience shows that at this stage of manufacture the two horn strips, however carefully butted in the first place, are almost sure to part, thereby creating a gap, which, if left as such, would cause unfair shearing stresses to be thrown on to the bond between wood and horn when the bow is braced and drawn. To remedy this defect, a slim piece of packing—nearly always to be found in Oriental composite bows—was. inserted between the ends of the horn strips. In existing bows it is of bone or ivory. This component was the ibranjak (see Glossary, s.v.), the purpose of which proved so problematical to Faris and Elmer (Arab Archery, p. 162, where it is - tentatively suggested that it may have. been a shock-absorber). It is mentioned later by our author on a number of occasions without any explanation, but it was, as Mustafa Kani says of the chelik—the term applied to the ibranjak of the Ottoman flight bow--the piece which united the two halves of the bow. It served the additional purpose of helping to maintain the reflex shape in the grip of the bow and of adding to its rigidity. It should be noted that where reflex in the handle does exist, it is slight, and the centre part of most Middle Eastern bows is virtually straight except in so far as it is shaped to fit the hand.

When the glue had thoroughly set, the impregnated sinew was hard enough to be shaped with a file. After removal of any obvious irregularities and hardened exuded glue, the bow was strung for very short periods at a time so that the bowyer could study the curves of the two limbs.  The process of tillering then began so that both limbs, when adjusted, might be brought to the correct curve. During this time the bow would periodicaily be braced and drawn gradually to increasing degrees until it could be brought to full draw with even balance in both limbs. Heat and formers were used to assist in shaping the limbs.

In the last stages of manufacture the sinew backing of the bow was veneered with tree bark applied diagonally in strips so as to prevent it from splitting when the bow was drawn. To make it waterproof, it was varnished and then painted for the sake of appearance. A sinew binding beside the nocks strengthened the wood against any danger of its splitting under the impact of the string’s loops at these points when the bow was shot. Turkish and Persian bows are usually found to have a strip of horn let into the tip to strengthen the ear (Fig. 10), but we have come across no mention of this.

### The Painting of Bows

Our author says nothing whatever about the painting of bows, but in --GET THE FULL NAME--, there is an addendum to the text giving instructions for the painting of bows with *sandarūs* - presumably sandarac, a colourless resin from the tree of that name. The directions may be summarised as follows:

Mix any desired colour with liquid sandarac, Apply and allow to dry off. Next, apply a varnish of pure sandarac and dry off. Now coat the surface with strong (? text uncertain) ox-gall. Apply paint of another colour to give, for instance, white on black, or red on green, or blue on red, and then place in the hot sun, When appropriate, sprinkle carefully with wine vinegar to bring up the colours in the design and dry off. Next wash off the gall and dry. Now apply sandarac by itself and leave. If desired, apply another colour in similar fashion.

### Dimensions of Bows

The measurements given for parts of the bow are summarized below. Those for the grip do not include the tapered portions fitting into the *dustārs*.  Column 1 shows the normal measurements as given by our author.  Column 2 shows the variations which he records.




|                      | 1 (inches) | 2 (inches) |
|----------------------|------------|------------|
| Upper siyah          | 6.55       | 5.73       |
| Upper dustar         | 16.36      | 16:40      |
| Grip                 | 4.91       | 4.91       |
| Lower dustár         | 15.82      | 16.23      |
| Lower siyah 6.27 in. | 6.25       | 5.46       |
|----------------------|------------|------------|
| TOTAL                | 49.91 in.  | 48.73 in.  |


It will be noticed that the author gives the total length of the bow shown in column I as 50.2 in., so there would appear to be some minor discrepancy in the figures. For all practical purposes, however, the difference is negligible.

The lower limb of Taybughā's Syrian bow was shorter than the upper, and, although this characteristic is found in other designs, most composite bows from the Middle East that have so far been examined have limbs of equal length — an advantage in that they could be used either way up.

Compared with those of existing bows, our author's *siyahs* seem very short and his *dustars* long.  This would result in a slight decrease in the efficiency of the bow owing to understressing of the materials from which it was made. On the other hand, it would be a little more reliable in war and less liable to fracture or damage.

To illustrate these differences, we have drawn up a table of detailed measurements made from a selection of existing bows. It should, however, be noted that since it is usually very difficult to decide exactly where one section ends and another begins, the table below may contain minor errors.

| Bow                     | Siyahs      | Dustars | Grip           | Total |

The Khorasanian bow to which our text refers would at the most have been only 37 in. long, which is short even by comparison with the Ottoman flight bow.

The following additional information occurs in D+, 15b and is of some interest:—

--REPLACE WITH ACTUAL NAME--

> They (sc. the Turks, Persians and Iraqis) divide the bow into half at the halfway mark on the grip so that whichever limb is the weaker is taken by them to be the shooting limb (i.e. the upper). The Khorasanians do not believe in applying [too much] sinew to their bows . . . and accordingly use less of this material than any other. With the Iraqis, on the other hand, sinew and horn are used in equal proportions. This is because of climatic differences in these countries.  Experts say that if you are in a very hot country, you should soak the sinew with good, pure, well-prepared parchment glue because it gives moisture and suppleness suited to such a country and excessive heat...

Specifications given by other authors cannot always be directly compared as they may refer to a bow of different design from that described in the present treatise. It is, however, interesting to record the observation of the author of the Nib*Nihāyah* that the longest bow should be 12 *qabdahs* (‘fists’, i.e. about 39 1/2 in.) and the shortest 8 *qabdahs* (about 26 in.). The longest *siyahs* should, he adds, be 16 fingers (about 13 in.) and the shortest 10 fingers (about 8 in.).  (*Nihāyah*, Ch. vii, p. 72.) If our equivalent for the *qabdah* is correct (see Appendix 1), the length of the bow must have been measured by a different method from that indicated by Taybugha.  It may have been based on the shortest distance between the nocks or tips of the braced bow.

### The Flight Bow

The mention of long necks in connexion with the flight bow probably implies that the ridged section of the siyah in the kind of bow with which the author was familiar extended a few inches further towards the grip than in the case of the war bow, thereby shortening the *dustār*. That in its turn would give a higher speed of recovery to the tips of the bow when the string was loosed. This would normally result in a lower degree of accuracy, since the two limbs of the bow might not travel forward exactly together. Such an effect, however, would be of no consequence in flight shooting where discharge velocity is the all-important factor. Far greater stress would also be thrown on to the shorter working part of the limb, making such & bow less suitable for warfare.


### Crossbows

283 In Arabic the crossbow is termed ‘foot-bow’ (*qaws ar-rijl*). The origin of the term is simply explained in Mardi t-Tarūusī's description of the type of crossbow with which he was familiar in the reign of Saladin: '.. . they (sc. crossbows) are drawn by applying the pressure of both feet together with the strength of the back, for, in order to pull, one must fasten around the waist a well-tanned and toughened belt of ox-hide, at the end of which arc two hooks to take the string.  One then puts the feet inside the bow . . . and with the back pulls the belt at the point where the two hooks are until the string reaches the catch (*qaff*) located in the stock . . .’

Another type of crossbow-— possibly a later development—required the use of one foot only. The foot was placed in a stirrup fitted to the front of the stock (Fig. 3b). This was the *qaws ar-rikāb or ‘stirrup bow’. Europe distinguished between the two by the terms *arbalista ad duos pedes* and *arbalista ad unum pedem* (Payne-Gallwey, Crossbow, p. 60).

Because of the relative instability of nomenclature and technical and semantic developments, it would be unwise to be dogmatic about the meaning of certain terms used by our author in connexion with crossbows. Some information on Middle Eastern crossbows and arbalests may be derived from Reinaud, Huuri, Cahen, and others, but there is insufficient technical detail to enable us to determine their construction.

--REPLACE CD WITH NAME IF POSSIBLE--

* *Jarkh*. From Ch. 16 and glosses in CD it is clear that, so far as our
 author is concerned, this was the stirrup bow. It shot a bolt.

* *Zanbūrak*, "little wasp’. What meaning the term had for our author we cannot say. It appears, at some stage or another, to have been a weapon which shot a strong, heavy bolt of the same name closely resembling the Western quarrel (Reinaud, pp. 211-13; Cahen, 153-54).

* *Bandūq* (more correctly *bundug*). This was the *gaws al-bunduc*, a type of crossbow that shot pellets (*bunduq*) of metal of that name. In the present context the term is not to be understood as the firearm of the same name (nor in the case of *zanbūrak*.)

* *Laqshah*. We have no information at all on this weapon.

### The Naval Crossbow

Because damp sea air could have a most adverse effect on glue, the composite construction with wood, horn, and sinew, which was often employed in crossbows before the introduction of steel limbs, was unsuitable for naval operations. The best solution to the problem lay in the use of the more simple, but more reliable, wooden limbs. The yew recommended by Taybugha is one of the finest bow woods obtainable, but there are problems in working it as the craftsman has to pay close attention to the run of the grain. By taking a length of the wood and splitting it in half, two lengths can be obtained with an almost identical run in the grain. If one length is then revesed and joined to the other, the two limbs should be almost identical. In this way the bowyer’s problems are eased, and a better bow results. Such is the most probable explanation of the ‘two opposing staves’ indicated by our author.
