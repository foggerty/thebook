# 5 - On arrows

The best arrows should possess the following characteristics. They should be roundly hewn, be of hard, solid wood, and be entirely devoid of knots, splinters, and pitting. They should be free from distortion and rotate quite evenly when twirled on the finger nail, especially when you spin them [with right finger and thumb] as they rest upright on their heads [in the centre of the right palm]. The swiftest arrows are those of slim contour with low fletchings and thick fore-shaft (*musaddar*; see Glossary). An arrow of this description is termed a [candle-form] (*qālib ash-sham'ah*). It should be thickest at the arrowhead and then gradually taper until it reaches its narrowest at the base of the nock. The nock (*fūq*) should be circular and of the same size as the thickest part (*badan*) of the shaft. The most accurate arrows are of the ‘barley-grain’ contour (*qālib ash-sha'irah*) with a middle thicker than the ends. They should be equipoised when balanced without head or fletchings. Straight-hewn (*mustawi n-naht*) arrows are those of uniform thickness from end to end, As long arrows they are inferior to the other two types, but as short they are better than either. (Short arrows are presumably those for use with an arrow-guide or with a crossbow as opposed to the normal ‘long arrows'.)

The nock should be of medium size, for a thick nock will slap the grip, and you will then spoil your shot. The thin nock, on the other hand, is weak (and will readily break). For short arrows the archer should put a thread around the circumference of the string and then, dividing it into three, make the nock the size of one of these thirds. It follows from this observation that as every bow has its own particular string, the arrow nock should in each individual case be one- third of its circumference. In the same way you also determine the size of a crossbow nut (*jawzah*) and its aperture (i.e. in the crossbow). This will be dealt with later. *Khart* arrows (?) are useless.

Specialists say that the most suitable heads for both *maydāni* arrows and *yaghliq*, or war, arrows are those with a weight one-seventh of that of the whole shaft plus its head (*nasl*). Anything short of, or in excess of, this specification is wrong. For, if the head is too heavy, the arrow will gad (*tahyarraka*) on its descent to the mark, while if it is too light it will gad as soon as it leaves the string. This is quite apparent in the case of crossbow bolts. The heavier the head, the more effective it is at short range, [but at long range it will topple and do little damage].

It is related that Tahir (*al-Balkhi*) told the following story: ‘I had heard,’ he said, ‘of a certain Persian against whose arrows no man could protect himself owing to their power of penetration. So I sought him out and worked for him for a time, though I was afraid to ask any questions. Eventually he went out hunting one day. By this time I had joined the family and so I was able to say to his wife, “There is something I should very much like you to do for me.” "And what is that?" she asked. “Please show me your husband's bow,” I said.  So she gave me one of his bows, and I drew it. Much to my surprise it was as light (*layyin*) as ours. “Good heavens!” I exclaimed. “Can your husband pierce any kind of armour with a bow as light as this?” “Yes,” she replied, “there are two things about it which enable him to do so. Just look at his bowstring and his arrowhead.” To my surprise the string was as thick as one’s finger and the arrowhead exceedingly large.’ We have put this story to the test and found that it is as Tāhir says.

The most reliable and effective arrowheads are those which are either triangular or square (in cross-section). These are for use in battle and for piercing iron and all kinds of armour. There are various types of arrowheads, of which the most useful are those just mentioned. The *haydari* head (a broadhead for hunting?) is not as good as either of these two kinds, Target heads (*nusūl al-ahdāf*) should be rounded. There is also a kind of head resembling an olive, which, some masters have told me, is the most useful of all arrowheads for battle and for piercing shields and which in Turkish territory is used by archers more than any other type. They also have an arrowhead resembling a chisel. Like the *maydāni*, it is cylindrical, but its tip is not pointed. On the contrary, it looks as if it has been cut [obliquely] from its [lineal] mid-point and tapered [to a blade] on two opposite sides so as to present the appearance of a scalpel. The edge [of the blade] is as wide as the diameter of the body. I have tested this head and found that it will pierce the laminae of a brigandine (*qarqal*) as well as it is possible to do so.

The art of mounting the arrowhead lies in observing the following rules, The head should be evenly rounded on all sides, no one side being heavier than another. It must be so made that it is perfectly straight from its point to the end of its tang (*silān*), the end of the tang being narrower than its base. The wood of the shaft should be bored [right in the centre] to a distance that is less than the length of the tang of the arrowhead so that its end can be inserted into un-bored wood in its natural state (*khām*) (and so fit tightly). The war head, and indeed any arrowhead designed to penetrate iron, should be made of steel. In these cases the tip must be tempered, and a fraction snipped off if it is intended to pierce laminae of armour. This technique is a well-guarded secret, and the result a weapon capable of piercing armour plates and shoulder-guards. The heavier it is, the greater its power of penetration. This is well known.

As regards fletchings (*rish*), there are different types. The best and most serviceable are vulture feathers, after which come those of the eagle. Right-handed feathers make more accurate arrows and are suitable for *maydānis*. Left-handed feathers, on the other hand, give a swifter arrow and are suitable for flight and war arrows. The way to distinguish the right-handed from the left-handed is to put the nock of the arrow to your breast, and if the feathers lean over to the right, they are right-handed, whereas if they lean over to your left, they are left-handed (the converse is the case in English practice), It is wrong to fletch the one arrow with both types.  It should be fletched either wholly with right-handed feathers or vice versa. The rule for a set (*nadab*) of *maydāni* arrows is to have them all exactly alike. For when feathers differ in kind none of the arrows are any good. The most useful fletchings are the *makyūl* or ‘balance pan’ (?) variety closely followed by ‘gazelles’. The longest fletchings should be no more than six finger-widths and the shortest three. Fletchings that are long and low (*lāti*) are better than those which are short and high (*'ālt*). At their highest they should be no more than a finger-width. Four feathers hold a truer course and give better grouping and greater accuracy, but three are faster and give greater range (*asbaq*). There are some archers who use six feathers, three low and small and three high and long, but too many feathers retard an arrow.  For best results there should be one-half of a finger-width between the feather and (the beginning of) the nock. The feather should be cut from the base, and the tips left like those of a swallow’s wings. On a flight arrow you fit only three fletchings.

They say that tail-feathers are better for an arrow than wing-pinions because the latter will not lie straight on the shaft. Nevertheless, secondaries are better than tail-feathers because they are more pliable.

Every feather has a belly and a back, so see to it that fletchings are put belly to back. For when they clash and are belly to belly, the arrow is ruined, as is also the case if one feather is higher or longer than another. An archer who shoots arrows that are fletched (*murayyash*) with left-handed feathers should aim for the right of the target and vice versa.

The centre portion of a feather gives a better fletching than either of its two extremities. A feather on a shaft should not be twisted (*maftūl*). The further the fletchings are from the nock, the better the cast and the truer the course. The same is true of light feathers.

In one of the Maghrebi manuals [on archery] the author says that the skilful archer should fletch some of his arrows from the right wing and some from the left so that if he is shooting and the wind then comes in from his left, he can shoot with fletchings taken from the right wing.  If, on the other hand, the wind comes in from his right, he can shoot with left-handed fletchings.  Under such conditions arrows so fletched are more suitable and will not fall short as others not so fletched will do. The author also says that one should bend the rear end of the feathers in the direction to which they themselves incline, for if they are bent over backwards (i.e. as opposed to bellywise), they will cause the arrow to gad. If one spirals them too much, however, the arrow will fall short in its course. The best fletchings are tail-feathers.

Archers differ on the size of the arrow an archer should use. The correct measurement should be such that it will allow the archer at full draw comfortably to bring the head of the arrow to the distal phalanx of the thumb at the centre of the bow’s grip as the middle phalanx of the right index finger (*shahādah*) is brought right back to the lobe of the ear. The right elbow should be on a level with the shoulders, as also the hand grasping the bow. All should be on the same level (ie. in the horizontal plane), none of these parts being higher [or lower] than another. The optimum, then, is the length of the draw (*jadhb*) of which an archer is capable and which will at the same time permit a graceful appearance. The whole person should be evenly poised by which, [to repeat,] is meant that the right elbow, the shoulders and the left fist should be on the one level, none of these parts of the body being higher or lower than another.

The length of the *maydāni* arrow in our time and country (i.e. Syria) is, in terms of the carpenter’s cubit, one and one-eighth cubits and one-half of a girar (30 in.). Such an arrow is called *tamām* (‘full length"). This measurement, of course, is intended for really medium men.  A tall man (with long arms) will have to have it longer, while a short one (with short arms) will be unable to bring it to full draw (*'ajaza ‘an istifā ihi*) and will in consequence have to have it shorter. The war arrow should be one *qīrāt* (1.1 in.) less (ie. than the standard *maydāni*).

To find the correct balance (*awzān*, lit. ‘weights’; he means the correct position of the centre of gravity), first place the arrow across the left index finger [with the nock towards the palm of the hand] and balance it. When it is evenly poised like the beam of a balance, reduce the length of it by a fist "by grasping it with your left hand, your little finger being placed at the fletching end. This is to be done without allowing any shift in the balance already established. Next, with another arrow you measure the distance from the nock (*kāz*) to the little finger and then, by reversing this gauge, measure the same distance from the arrowhead. If the point which was on the little finger now reaches the left index finger (*sabbābah*) - some say the middle finger - the arrow is correctly balanced (in other words, the centre of gravity should be half a fist, or slightly less, towards the head from the middle of the arrow). If [the measure] reaches beyond [the left index finger], the head is too heavy, while if it falls short, it is too light.

The nock (*kāz*) should be of medium size, neither too small nor too big. The arrow for use with the *jarkh* should [easily fit into] the nut and neither shift about in it nor fit too tightly.

To determine the correct balance of *jarkh* arrows and darts (*nabl*) intended for use with arrow-guides, you reduce the length of the arrow by a fist from the direction of the head and then place it on the left index finger and balance it. If it rests there like the beam of a balance, it is correct.  If not, what we have already said above also applies here. As regards the *qalam* (a type of crossbow bolt), it should balance with the base of the head on the left index finger.  With the arrow designed for the *mukhulah* the balance is between the proportions of one-third and one-quarter, the quarter being taken from the direction of the head and the remainder from the direction of the nock. If it will balance in this manner, it is just right.

A heavy head is better than a light one in all cases, especially in the case of arrows for use with the *mukhulah* and the *jarkh* and also in the case of darts. A light head is useless. There is a type of bolt (*nabl*) with a tip of iron the size of a small chickpea, the shaft (*badan*) being thinner than the tip and only as heavy as the whole head. The upper portion (i.e. the shaft) is of wood and of the same size as the nock. To be correctly balanced, it should equilibrate on the left index finger with one-third of it in front and two-thirds behind. They say it will fly without fletchings, but fletchings do help it. It is designed to penetrate armour.

The more slender, or thinner, an arrow, the greater its velocity, whereas the thicker it is, the more inefficient and slower it is.
