733 Points of tension and relaxation are of vital importance to good shooting. The requirements vary with the archer’s technique, which, in turn, varies with the purpose to which the bow is put.  The style of shooting known as the zension method was that of the longbow both in the days when it was still a weapon of war and long after it had ceased to be such and archery had become a pastime. The emphasis lay on firmness in all actions and a tight grip on the bow (Archery (Badminton), Ch. xx, pp. 331-83). With the improvement of bow design a major change in technique followed the development of modern target bows, and the relaxed method, in which every possible tension was avoided, became the vogue. In particular, the archer was to grasp loosely, relax the wrist of his bow-hand, and keep his knees at ease. In more recent years, however, there has been a tendency to attach greater importance to tension. A straight wrist, for instance, is now widely favoured, and archers in general have adopted a semi-tension method. There are, of course, many individual variations (on which, see Elmer, Target Archery, pp. 415-21).

Contemporary shooting technique closely approximates to that advocated by Taybugha. If we except the manner in which the drawing hand is applied to the string (above, p. xxv), the only major difference—for the present at least—is the grip on the bow. Pushing the bow away from them with the fork between thumb and index finger, many archers now shoot with an open hand and wear a strap on the wrist to prevent the bow from falling as each shot is completed.

734In much the same way as Taybughà, Mustafa Kani furnishes his readers with a list of thirty- four points requiring tension, relaxation, or stillness, as the case may be, Although strikingly similar to our author's list, it is by no means identical with it. It has been adapted to meet the needs of the Ottoman flight archer who not only used the siper (Fig. 40), but also built up the grip of his bow with a strip of wax-impregnated linen termed mushamma’ (Klopsteg, pp. 71-73 and his fig. 35). Of these, the first required him to put a slight arch on his wrist as viewed from the side, while the second provided the additional support needed by the hand and wrist to main- tain a correct and unvarying grip on the bow. Understandably, Mustafa Kani takes account of this and other factors and adapts his list of points accordingly. Two of his details may be singled out. Firstly, it should be noted that whereas it may be correct for a flight shooter to hold his jaw well into his left shoulder with neck tensed (Jsi., XV, p. 236), the same technique would be wholly incorrect in target shooting or on the battlefield. The second detail worthy of note is that Mustafa Kani extends his points of stillness to include the lungs. Correct breathing, of which Taybughà surprisingly says nothing, is a very important point and applies to all forms of archery.  Its importance was particularly recognized by the Japanese (Acker, Japanese Archery, pp. 42-48).

certain inconsistencies developing from some kind of fault or will have sustained injuries— mostly minor—caused by some error in technique. Although he may well be aware that his shooting is marred by a fault, he may find it extremely difficult to determine its nature without the aid of a competent coach or some other person qualified to subject his every action to technical scrutiny. It is obviously of great value to the archer who knows that his technique is defective to be able to check the various possible causes against a simple list of the kind contained in our treatise. In this way he can be sure that nothing has been overlooked.

736In Arab Archery, in which seven chapters (xxii-xxviii) are devoted to errors and their remedies, the subject is handled differently. A specific result of some fault, such as the string's hitting the forearm, is taken and its possible causes then discussed. Though perfectly adequate, the treatment is not as detailed or comprehensive as Taybughà's, and there is little to be gained from an exhaustive comparison.

The MSS of groups CD offer a slightly different version from that in our text. The main difference is that the list embraces only thirty-two points. Taken as a whole, the differences are so slight as to be of little account.
