# 24 - On the archer’s need to recognize his faults and know the correct use of his arms

The right arm is to archery what a leader is to men because it is the source of all the might and grace of an archer’s shooting. Likewise, it is from this arm that his shooting derives its effectiveness and penetrative power. It must, therefore, be carefully watched. His left arm must also receive equal care and attention since this arm is to archery what a foundation is to a building.  For, should an archer be ever so meticulous in his care for the right arm, but a little careless of the left, that small degree of carelessness would vitiate all his diligence in his care for the right.  Conversely, should he be ever so meticulous in his care for the left arm and be a little careless of the right, that small degree of carelessness would, again, vitiate all his diligence in his care for the left. The reason for this is that if right and wrong are combined, the result is two wrongs. If the archer, therefore, detects any flaw or failing in his shooting, he should proceed to set things to rights by first examining his bow and arrows. Should he find in them any imperfection, he should not shoot with them until he has put them in order. If, on the other hand, he can find nothing wrong in that direction, he should consider his body and correct anything that may have gone wrong with it without his realizing.

One thing I have noticed in my own experience is that some days an archer may shoot correctly with weapons and limbs alike in perfect shape, and yet, on others, find there are flaws and not much accuracy in his shooting. Again, on other days he will find that for no obvious reason he will achieve a higher standard of accuracy than that which it is in him, or within his usual power, to attain. I have gone into this point and often asked experts in archery, doctors of theology and sages to tell me the reason for this, but have never had any explanation apart from that given me by a certain saintly person who observed, ‘Don’t you know that there are two kinds of day to Fate—one that is for you, and one that is against you?’ I praised God and thanked the man for his explanation.

Overmuch shooting can sometimes stupefy an archer. What happens is that he goes on shooting for days without taking a single day off and then finds himself befuddled by it. He tries hard to achieve accuracy, but fails because he has used his limbs so much that fatigue and stiffness have set in, and he is overcome by a kind of boredom and irritation caused by a surfeit of shooting. For this malady I have never known any remedy other than shooting at neither target nor mark.  What the archer should do in this case is to stand on a high place and shoot into the air, giving his eye and mind to what he is doing with his arms and not to any particular target. If he can take up flight shooting and compete with himself for distance, he will find it the best possible cure.  He should carry on doing this for some days until he recovers his ability to aim, regains his accuracy, and gets rid of his mental confusion without any loss of practice, This piece of advice is an excellent tip for an archer who applies himself assiduously to target shooting. The best way, in fact, for a target shooter to practise is for him to shoot and rest on alternate days, for if he does so, he will not become dazed, fatigued, or bored, and he will continually improve in everything on which he expends his energies.
