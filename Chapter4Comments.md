COMMENT r, Materials

303 As already stated in our introduction, the basic requirements of a good bowstring are that it should be light, strong, and without stretch once it has settled to the bow. The strings recom- mended by our author were made of unspun, raw silk whose threads were twisted together to form a string of the required length. Glue was used to bind the strands together, the purpose being not only to prevent entanglement upon removal of the string from the bow, but also to increase the strength of the string. Wax could be used instead, but it is not mentioned in our text.

Although silk is Taybugha’s one and only choice, it is noteworthy that Mardi, writing in the twelfth century, makes no mention of any material other than animal hide—and human skin!— though he advocates a mixture of silk with horse-hair for the string of the siege engine called ziyár (Tabsirah, 83a, 97b-98a. Cf. Cahen, BEO, XII, p. 130). The author of Arab Archery, pp.  94-95, while mentioning silk, does not attach the greatest importance to it, but deals at some length with strings made from camel-hide. ‘To produce a string of this material, a strip of leather was subjected to various processes of stretching, twisting, smoothing, and, finally, coating with gum arabic. (On the use of hides, see also Hein, Zs/., XV, p. 7.) It is possible that in early times Turkish strings were made of horse-hair (Hein, ibid., p. 1. Cf. Klopsteg, p. 54).

304 2. Loops '

Most existing strings for use with Oriental composite bows are made with the end loops quite separate from the main string. The latter is a long skein of thread formed by winding around two pegs set at the required distance apart. The loops are knotted into the ends of the skein, as shown in Fig. 13. The same knot was used in bowstrings throughout the East from China to Turkey.  Though more rarely found, some strings were made longer $o that they could be knotted back upon themselves to form the end loops.

The advantage of this second type was that a string-maker could supply prepared lengths which the user could knot to suit his own bow. This would certainly be the more practical approach for the archer in combat and was, we suggest, that adopted by our author, whose interests in the present treatise are primarily military. The first method would impose the necessity of having the skeins of exactly the right length, which would mean that they would have to be made to order unless the archer was prepared to perform the task himself.

| 3. Bracing Height

308For accurate shooting, the bracing height, or distance between the grip and the string of a braced bow, must be constant. Any alteration will affect discharge velocity, a greater height reducing that velocity and a lower height increasing it. Too low a height, moreover, will give rise to an unstable bow. The bracing height achieved by a bowstring of specified length in relation to a given bow can, therefore, be an important guide to anyone attempting to determine the design of a bow. Some versions of our text give measurements amounting to 9-1 in., while others give the equivalent of 7-3 in. A reconstruction of Taybughà's bow from all other specifications at our disposal suggests that the latter figure is correct. (See p. 170.)
