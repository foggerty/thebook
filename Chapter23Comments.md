COMMENT 1. The Schools of Archery

824 From a comparison of some of the more important treatises relevant to the subject it is apparent—and certain of our observations on preceding chapters will have led the reader to suspect as much—that, in Islamic archery literature generally, there are discrepant versions of the teachings of Abū Hashim, Tahir, and Ishaq. In particular, the account of their systems contained in the foregoing chapter is at variance with that of at-Tabari as transmitted in his Kita al-wadih (26a-46b; Ist., 19b-34b), which, incidentally, as the source of many of the ascriptions appearing in Arab Archery, accounts for some points of difference between that work and this,

Familiarity with the technical literature and an awareness of the Islamic predilection for a personal originator of almost any teaching or doctrine combine to make us highly sceptical of the authenticity of ascriptions which the absence of objective criteria makes it difficult or impossible to control. The emergence of personal schools of archery, we suspect, represents the organization of teaching into a coherent system, in which names enjoying the sanction of tradition are used either to legitimize current practice or to promulgate new methods. That Abi Hashim, Tahir, and Ishaq were historical persons, we have no reason to doubt, but whether any of them was the real originator of a technique or system, or merely the leading exponent of a technique or system as taught and practised in a given geographical area at a given time-~and this is not unlikely— is just one of the questions for which we have, as yet, no positive answer.

825In our treatise these three Great Masters emerge as ideal specimens of two physical extremes and a golden mean and, as such, seem no more than a methodological convenience for an exposi- tion of the author's teaching. In the Wadih, on the other hand, it is deducible from the systems ascribed to them that none of them was a perfect example of such physical types. On this and other grounds it is legitimate to surmise that their somatic differences were not so absolute as portrayed in aftertimes and were indeed of less consequence than one might be led to suppose.

While physical characteristics are of evident importance to some facets of shooting technique— the nature of one's grasp, for instance—they are by no means the whole story. It must be remem- bered that from ancient times the archer in combat more often than not protected his person with armour which, to a greater or lesser degree according to its nature, added to his bulk or deprived him of the unrestricted use of his body, or both, To illustrate, let us consider the helmet.  Many of the earlier surviving specimens of Turkish and Persian helmets are equipped with nasals, or nose-bars, that could be slid up or down in their fittings and locked in the desired position by means of a threaded bolt (Stone, Glossary of Arms and Armor, s.v. Armor, pp. 36-51, and figs. 50-58, 61-64). A nasal might extend down the face as far as the wearer’s chin, and, when shooting a bow in an acutely oblique position like that of Abü Hashim, the archer would not have been able to turn his head in comfort more than about forty-five degrees towards the target. If his drawing hand was in contact with the side of his face as he loosed, it is difficult to see how the string could avoid catching the nasal and ruining the shot, to say nothing of any other inconvenience or injury that might result if his head was turned too much. He might, of

course, remove the nasal or Jock it in the raised position, but he could not always count on having the opportunity of doing so. Similar problems could obviously arise from the wearing of armour, be it plate or mail, and both the Wadi and Arab Archery leave us in no doubt that the Muslim archers of the Middle East recognized its importance as a factor in the choice of posture (e.g. Wadih, 34a-b, 39b-402, 45b-46b; Arab Archery, pp. 81 ff.). Tahir’s adherents, we are told, rejected Abū Hashim's position of acute obliqueness because of the string’s liability to catch protrusive items of armour. To face the target directly, on the other hand, had in their view the advantage of eliminating this hazard and at the same time not restricting the archer to one coat of mail (zardiyyah). It did not, however, permit, as did Abū Hashim’s position, the use of the kind of shield with which Khorasanians were wont to protect themselves while actually shooting, nor did it admit of a powerful draw. Both these disadvantages could be overcome by the use of the intermediate position. In view of Taybughà's emphasis on archery in warfare it is surprising that he says nothing of such considerations, for they must have been of greater importance than physique as witness the fact that today most Western archers, regardless of build, stand sideways to the target.

827With the crystallization of theoretical teaching into three systems at-Tabari, it would seem, came face to face with the obvious problem of the individual who fell neatly into none of the three stereotyped classes of physique for which the systems catered. His solution was simple and

characteristic of the Islamic way of thinking. Skilfully avoiding innovation which could well discredit him, he reconciled the claims of individuality with those of ‘orthodoxy’ and tradition by the application of the eclectic principle. In so doing he satisfied an obvious need and set a useful example, thereby earning himself recognition as a Master—in the sense of founder of a school—in his own right. :

830The four schools, or systems (madhahib), of archery based on allegiance to the teaching of a Master (imám) are strikingly reminiscent of the four orthodox schools (madhahkib) of Islamic law, each perpetuating the doctrine of a Master (idm) and his disciples. Since the systems of our text are, as already indicated, not those described by at-Tabari, we may well suspect that the respectable framework of orthodoxy underpinned by time-honoured names is being used as a cloak for the promulgation of what is either the author's own teaching or teachings reflecting current practice.


2. At-Tabari’s Technique

831 If we discount the misleading matter of discrepant ascriptions, the practice of at-Tabari as laconically recorded in our text does not, so far as the record goes, fundamentally diverge from that described in the Wadik (59a-62b; Ist., 452-48b). The only major difference concerns his grasp on the bow which was.,from what he himself says, intermediate and not oblique as stated above. Although the two MSS do not wholly agree, that of Istanbul being more corrupt than that of the British Museum, we nevertheless venture the following account of his methods:


"Whether standing or squatting, I prefer to take a slightly oblique position and set the target in line with my left eye. In this I follow the system of Ishaq ar-Raffa’. When bracing, the middle phalanges of my left index finger and middle finger are in contact with my right knee. When nocking, I first set the notches (alag at-taftoig/al-fuvág) of my arrows on the middle phalanx of my middle finger and firmly hold the bottom of the notches with the tips of my thumb and index finger. I next push the arrow sharply forward until the string strikes the base of my thumb and index finger without at any time allowing the shaft (badan) of my arrow to leave the string. Then, without looking, I bring the nock back, slip it on the string, and Iock ‘63’.  Lodging the string in the crease of my thumb, I have my index finger on top of the thumb and the string opposite the mid-point of the very tip of the index finger. In the lock, I have the cusps (daffatáni, sing. daffah) of the nock between the proximal phalanx and middle crease of my index finger. In this I follow the system of Tahir al-Balkhi.

832In grasping the bow, I set the marn (above, p. 45) of the grip between the crease formed at the base of the four fingers and the middle crease thereof. In this I follow the system of Abū Hashim, The upper end of the grip’s belly (ibranjak) I place between the two phalanges [ sic; it must be ‘joints’] of my thumb in conformity with Tahir’s teaching, and the lower part one finget's width from the wrist-bone in accordance with that of Ishiq.

When aiming, I displace the lower siyah to the right and bring it back to vertical with a twist of my forearm at the very moment I begin to draw, and in this I follow Tahir. Using my bow-hand to focus, I direct the tip of my arrowhead (ra’s an-nagl) on to the centre of the mark.  I aim with both eyes together outside the bow and, in sighting, I depend essentially on my right eye, though I use it in conjunction with my left. In this I follow Ishaq. I do not lower my left arm for short range, nor do I raise it for long, On the contrary, the proximal phalanx of my left thumb will be in line with the end of my shoulder throughout the draw and remain absolutely level, moving neither upwards for long range nor downwards for short.

833In drawing, I execute one uninterrupted movement, as taught by Tahir, and bring back my arrow directly in line with the parting dividing my lips with no deviation either upwards or downwards, as taught by Isháq. When the arrowhead reaches the ibranjak, I pause for the

count of one or two for as long as it takes [reading b1-gadr (Ist.) for ba'd] for the arrow to settle

and be trained on the mark. I then take my hand from the string to a point in line with my shoulder, and, at that very moment of loosing, I disengage with a twist of the hand (farkah) and without too sharp a pull on the string lest my index finger catch any part of the nock or shaft. I throw out my chest and left arm until the ends of my shoulder-blades meet. In this I follow Tahir...’
