> ‘Drawynge well is the best parte of shootynge' (Ascham) -

### The Essentials of the Draw

With the performance of the draw the archer, now done with the preliminaries, enters upon that phase of shooting which is directly concerned with the shot. The arrow should be drawn smoothly and easily with fairly equal distribution of weight between both arms for ‘to drawe casely and vniformely, that is for to saye not waggyng your hand, now vpwarde, now downewarde, but alwayes after one fashion . . . is best both for profit & semelinesse’ (Ascham, p. 105).

Since the strength of the draw comes not from the arms, but from the muscles of the back and shoulders, the archer must, to achieve a powerful draw, keep the right elbow in the same horizontal plane as the shoulder while drawing. Once the bow is full-drawn, both arms should support and maintain equal tension until the arrow is loosed. To draw correctly is of great importance, for a bad draw will almost certainly culminate in a bad shot.

### Methods of Drawing

There are three basic methods of drawing: (a) that whereby the archer with hands relatively close together at waist height begins simultaneously to push against the bow, pull on the string, and raise the hands; as the bow moves upwards the distance between the hands is gradually increased V-wise until the bow is fully-drawn and the arrow horizontal; this technique is favoured by most modern archers and, so far as can be judged from our text, was our author's method also; (b) that whereby the archer raises their bow-arm almost fully extended towards the aiming point with little disturbance of the string until that arm is level, and then draws; (c) that whereby the archer raises both arms above the horizontal and draws as the hands are lowered to the correct elevation. This last method has always been favoured by the Japanese.

### Creep

It is nowadays Western practice to complete the draw and then to hold for several seconds during which final aim is taken. There is a great danger at this stage that the arrow will ‘creep’, or nose forward, either because of a slight bending of the bow-arm or an easing of the shoulders occasioned by muscle strain. If the arrow does creep, it will not be full-drawn at the moment of loosing and will accordingly fall short of the mark. Ascham, doubtless alive to this danger, advises that *Holdynge must not be longe . . . it must be so lytle y it maye be perceyued better in a mans mynde when it is done, than seene w' a mans eyes when it is in doyng’ (p. 105).
