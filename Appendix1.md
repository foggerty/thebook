# Appendix 1 - Weight and measures

In the course of Islamic history the values of units of measurement used in the Near and Middle East have varied according to time and place. Some impression of the difficulties created in consequence may be formed from a perusal of the Appendix to *Arab Archery*, in which it can be seen that measurements furnished by the Arabic original left Faris and Elmer groping for equivalents (sections 2, 6, 7, 11, 12, 13). The general mensural problem is aggravated by the fact that an author writing in one part of the Muslim world will, without acknowledgement, commonly quote, say, from earlier works originating in other parts and, in so doing, transmit specificatious expressed in terms identical in form with, but in value different from, those used in his own area and period. In determining the equivalents of units mentioned in the present work we have had the benefit of the unstinted advice of a noted authority in the field, Professor Walther Hinz of the University of Göttingen, author of *Islamische Masse und Gewichte* (Leiden, 1955) and contributor of the article on the cubit in the new edition of the *Encyclopaedia of Islām*. We gratefully acknowledge his assistance.

Fortunately for us, Taybughā does define his cubit as ‛the carpenter's cubit, that is to say, the Hāshimi cubit’. This statement in itself poses a problem since we know of no carpenter’s cubit that is the same as the Hashimite. However that may be, we have taken the latter as the basis of conversion with a value of 66.5 cm., or 26.18 in., though it must be noted that it varied between limits of 66.81 cm. and 66.27 cm. As for the *qirāt*, there were 24 to the cubit.

The *raṭl* of Damascus was constant at 600 *dirhams*, of which the exact equivalent is 1.85 kg., or 4.07 Ib. The weight of the Damascus *dirham* was therefore 3.086 grams, or 47.6 grains.

Having established these equivalents for weights given in the early part of the *Ghanyah*, we subsequently found mention of a bow of 100 *raṭls* (Ch. 16), or 407 lb. Since a bow of this weight is well beyond the limit of human strength it became evident to us that the expression ‘100 *raṭls*’ was either a figure of speech or quoted from some other source. If the second of these alternatives is the explanation, the bow of 100 *raṭls* is in all probability that which is frequently linked in Arabic archery literature with the name of Tāhir al-Balkhi, and the unit is almost certainly Iraqi. To the Iraqi *raṭl* there were either 128.4 *dirhams* or 130 *dirhams*, and, since the *dirham* equivalent is 3.125 grams, or 48.2 grains, the second figure - 130, to which we incline - gives a *raṭl* equivalent of 406.25 grains, or 14.3 oz.

All other problems apart, we must not lose sight of the hazard - encountered in some MSS - of copyists’ interpolations which introduce standards other than those intended. Thus, for instance, it does not follow that, because a text reads ‘x *raṭls* Damascus weight’, the author wrote the words ‛Damascus weight’. The copyist, once conditioned to this qualification, may have continucd to add it where the author deliberately omitted it. We have personally encountered this kind of interpolation and warn against uncritical acceptance of specifications occurring in Arabic sources.

The following table summarises the values offered by us for weights and measures in the Middle East during the fourteenth century:


#### Damascus, or Syrian, measure
| *Cubit*  | 665 cm.      | 26.18in.    |
| *Qirāt*  | 2.77 cm.     | 1.09 in.    |
| *Raṭl*   | 1850.0 grams | 4.07 lb.    |
| *Dirham* | 3.086 grams  | 47.6 grains |

### Baghdad, or Iraqi, measure
| *Cubit*              | 49.875 cm.   | 19:63 in. |
| *Raṭl*               | 406.25 grams | 14.3 oz.  |
| *Dirham* 3.125 grams | 48.2 grains  |           |

### Cairo, or Egyptian, measure
| *Cubit*  | 54.04 cm.   | 21-28 in.   |
| *Raṭl*   | 437.5 grams | 15.4 oz.    |
| *Dirham* | 3.125 grams | 48.2 grains |

NOTE:
    100 *raṭls* = 1 *qintār*
    I2 ūqiyyahs = 1 *raṭl*

The *fist*, the *finger*, and the *arm-span* were canonically standardised at 8.312 cm. (3.272 in.), 2.078 cm. (0.818 in.), and 199.5 cm., or almost 2 metres (2.188 yds.). We find these equivalents quite acceptable, but are by no means convinced that archers adhered exactly to such measures.  Certain indications in technical literature suggest that rule of thumb was not unusual. Furthermore, we do not know for sure that the canonical arm-span (4 Iraqi cubits) was that of the Mameluke archers in Syria. As regards the span, many dictionaries give an equivalent of 9 in., but it may be concluded from p. 29 that if the length of an arrow is 30 in., the span would be 7 1/2 in. As Elmer, a physician, points out, the average man cannot - he presumably means without undue strain and stretch - span much more than 8 in., whatever may be said to the contrary (Arab Archery, p. 159).

One final word: where conversions are given in the text, we avoid unrealistic numbers of decimal points and offer the nearest practical equivalents.
