# 18 - On standing before the target

A standing position (*qiyān*) willl afford the archer a greater degree of stability than can be achieved by squatting, and it has the additional advantage of being easier for the learner. There are four kinds of stance of which three are designed for target shooting and vary accordingly as the archer stands squarely to the mark (*munharif shadid**) or in a position of acute obliqueness (*munharif shadid*) or in an intermediate position (*mutawassit*) between these two extremes. Lastly, there is a stance to suit the archer’s needs in combat and flight shooting.

A learner should take up a slightly oblique stance before the mark and set the latter in line with his left eye. Keeping his left knee straight and pointing the toes of his left foot directly towards the mark, he should plant his right foot in a transverse position with the left heel pointing in the direction of his right instep (*bayād*). With sufficient space between his two feet to accom- modate the length of the bone of the forearm he should put his weight (*ya' tamid*) on the right foot and ease (*yukhiff() his left.

Using an alternative method, he can place the left foot in a transverse position so that its little toe is opposite the mark and plant the right foot lengthwise with its big toe pointing directly at the mark.

[There is yet another method. In this case the archer sets the mark] in line with his left shoulder and stands with both feet firmly planted in the transverse position. There should be no great gap between the two feet - only a span, or even less than that. This is Tāhir’s method.

## The Military Stance

In this position the archer has his Achilles’ tendons meeting, but parts his feet in front. He stands in this way because he is wearing armour. It is a difficult thing to do, [and I do not care for it], but I record it here in accordance with the practice of our masters, My own view is that the archer should put a space between his legs almost big enough to allow another man to pass between. In this way he can stand more firmly and can get up, stand, and dodge more rapidly.

In battle you can put your shield over your forearm, fasten it to it, and advance on the enemy sideways. When you eventually reach the spot where his arrows are falling, you drop on your knees with head down and hands on the ground and rotate your shield‘ over your head so that if the enemy shoots at you, none of his arrows will hit you. If one should hit, it will strike your shield.  If you are able to shoot at the enemy and so wish, you can nock and draw in that position without casting so much as a glance at him before bringing the arrow to full draw. You then raise your head, sight, and shoot. This is a very convenient manœuvre when one is engaged in siege operations against fortresses, cities, and the like.
