# 11 - On drawing the bow (*madd al-qwas*)

To draw, the points of grasp in each hand must be tensed, by which is meant, the little finger, the ring-finger, end the middle finger of both hands. At the same time both elbows must be tensed. In tensing the right elbow extra care must be taken because it is of fundamental importance to the achievement of a good draw.

It is related that a woman once brought a boy of hers to the Imam ash-Shāfi'i and asked him to teach him archery, to which he assented. ‘He must,’ she said, “be strong in both fists, quick at both points, and free from both faults.’ She turned on her heels, and the Imam ash-Shāfi'i quickly rose to pay her respect and asked her to which family she belonged. She told him that she was descended from Sa'd ibn Abī Waqqās. ‘You speak the truth,’ he said, ‘This is indeed his teaching.’

Authorities on archery are agreed that ‘strong in both fists’ refers to the tensing of the three appropriate fingers of both hands, but they disagree on what ‘both faults’ are. Some say that they are rapping (*tarq*) and ‘[deflecting the arrow by] slapping the arrow-pass (*tadmik*), though other opinions have been expressed in abundance, The truth of the matter is that the two faults are pinching [the nock] (*khanq*) and rapping, for these are the worst faults in archery (on faults and their consequences, sce below, Ch. 21. ‘Both points’ are left unexplained, but they are, we suggest, the nocking-point and the anchor-point, the reference being to speed in nocking).

When ready to draw the bow, tense your elbows and fists, then raise both hands and elbows until they are on a level with your shoulders, poised like the beam of a balance. Elbows, fists, and shoulders should be like a paper-rule, running in one straight line so that no one part is higher or lower than another. At all points the distance from this line to the ground should be the same. [To repeat and emphasize], the distance from this line to the ground should be one and the same at all points. This rule is reiterated to impress upon the novice that we have here a principle that is of fundamental importance to good shooting. All ancient archers gave their pupils the same advice.

Correct use of the right elbow is the essence of a good draw, and maximum draught is attained when the lobe of the ear is reached. Drawing to the lobe will enable the archer to determine what the length of his arrow should be. What he does is to put his back to a wall and bring the arrow to full draw (yastawft s-sahm) so that both his elbows come in contact with the wall. The draught of the arrow is then ascertained by noting that point on the shaft which is found at full draw to lie between the phalanges of the left thumb, for the distance between that point and the nock will be just the right length for his particular arrow. No other measurement will meet his needs.  This question of finding the length of one’s arrow has always been a problem to archers and a subject on which they have different ideas. For its solution the best teaching ever expounded is the one I have just described and, in recommending it, I have explained a method which men are loath to disclose and which is therefore left unmentioned by others.

It is reported that at-Tabari said, ''Abd ar-Rahmān al-Farāwi told me that there are ten points to effective shooting (*mikāyah*), of which nine lie in the attainment of maximum draught by a properly completed draw and only one in the archer’ (meaning, presumably, that a successful shot largely depends on the completion of a faultless draw). The completed draw (*wafā*) is one of three kinds: the lesser (*bidāyah*), the standard (*kifāyah*), and the greater (*nihāyah*).
