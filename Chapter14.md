# 14 - On the follow-through (*khatra*)

[*The khatrah is a particular kind of follow-through for which there is no satisfactory English equivalent.*]

To thrust the bow forward [with a downward push of the left hand] immediately after the loose is an action which has won the esteem and authority of prominent archers as a principle of fundamental importance. It has no place in the traditions of the ancients, but carries only the authority of latter-day archers of repute, who tried it, proved it, and formulated the dictum, 'Twist with your right hand and thrust with your left'. Although we have found no mention of this action by any of the founders of the great schools, experience testifies to its soundness and practical value. We can testify from experience that the movement increases both cast and range in the same way as a rider driving a horse can bear witness to an extra burst of speed when he gives his mount a lash in full career. It is a proven fact, however, that the action must be strongly executed and come from the wrist-joint like the punch of a man in anger. What the archer should do is to dip the bow [sharply] from the grip in such a way that the moment the string is losed he would appear to give his arrow a push with the string. [After the lose] the string may lightly strike forearm, thus enabling the archer to keep the bow under control and prevent it from dropping right down. [If of course, the bow can be checked] without the string's touching anything at all, so much the better.  The tone of the string, furthermore, will emit a clearer note [and thereby demonstrate a skillful archer's superiority].

Such is the teaching that has come down to us about this kind of follow-through.  We have put it to the test and proved its value. Needless to say, however, if the thrust anticipates the loose it will ruin a man's shooting, while if it is delayed, it will be pointless. It will certainly conceal his faults and at the same time enhance his appearance, but he should be aware of executing the operation with the whole arm as those unskilled in archery do, otherwise he will surely pay for his action; for the use of the whole arm will cause him to catch the shaft, and, if the thrust anticipates the departure of the arrow, [it will deviate from the course along which it is aimed]. If, on the other hand, the movement is accomplished when the arrow has already left, it will not only, as before, confer no advantage, but it may also, should it bring down the arm, be detrimental to the shooter, especially in combat, for he may well catch the *siyah* against something and break it. Alternatively, the *siyah* may strike him in the side and do him some injury. Add to which that, should an archer use the whole arm from a squatting position, he will strike the ground with the siyah and break it, while if he is mounted, he will strike his charger [or his comrades around him, especially in a crowded field]. Altogether it is a most dreadful fault, so beware of it.
