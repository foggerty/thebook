# Appendix 3 - Arrows: terminology


1010[C: The misrá' is a long arrow with four feathers; the Aazwah is an arrow the
size of aspan;" the rakib? is a huge arrow with plenty of iron in it; the
rmi'balah? is an arrow with a broad head.]


a. The term is almost certainly Persian and most probably fardzdn meaning ‘the
rearmost part’ (ef. pishán, ‘the most forward part’ of anything). On faráz
‘space above a thing’, see Redhouse, Lexicon, s.v.

. Not hafw as in Arab Archery, p. 103. See, inter alia, Mukhassas, VL p. 55.

. In the Mukhassas, VI, p. 55, sharijah is defined as ‘the sinew with which the
fletchings are attached’. The sinew which was placed over the heads of the
fletchings was termed kizamah (ibid.). By the ends of the fletchings are meant
the ends nearest to the nock. The heads of the fletchings were those nearest to
the arrowhead or those parts which were located where the haqu began, working
from the arrowhead upwards.

1013. In Arab Archery, p. 103, the main is defined as the foreshaft. The definition
given in Redhouse, Lexicon, s.v., is precisely the same as that which we are
given here: "The part of the shaft of an arrow from the middle of its length to
where the feathers begin.’

. Assuming that the reading is correct, it is hard to see why this part was so
called unless it was

because of its thickness which would make the shaft, when viewed longitudinally,
appear to bulge slightly on either side.

1021According to Arab Archery, p. 103, the breast is that part which runs from the
shaftment to the middle of the shaft. This docs not appear to have been the
case, for we read in the Mukhassas, VL, 54: ‘The zäfirah [not wafirah as in Arab
Archery] is that part of the shaft which comes below the fletchings. The part
which runs below that to the middle towards the thin portion of it is the
breast, but the term “breast” has begun to be applied only to that part of the
shaft which comes next to the arrowhead because it is to the fore when it is
shot. The rear of the shaft which comes next to the nock is termed ‘ajz.’ In
Arabic the term sadr is regularly applied to the front part of a thing. In the
Munjid, s.v., the zdfirah is more closely defined as the part which— working
from the atrowhead—the third of the shaft adjacent to the arrowhead.


- Mukhassas, Vl, p. 55: ‘The risáf are the sinews located above the socket.’
. The socket is called ru'z (ibid. Cf. Arab Archery, p. 103).

Defined by one source as any arrowhead in which there is a prominent ridge on a
flat surface.  What this was is not entirely clear. It is mentioned by Taybughà
(p. 77) as being most suitable for gourd shooting.


. The word is not vocalized and therefore difficult to transcribe,

Mi'rád is defined by Redhouse, Lexicon, s.v., as a ‘headless and featherless
arrow-shaft that often strikes sideways or with its middle part’. It is,
however, described in the Nihayah as follows: “This type of arrow leaves the bow
and flies sideways on to the mark, It will pass nothing without hitting it. I
will describe its appearance and how it works... You take a shaft and plane it
down. The nock should be very thin, It (the shaft?) should gradually thicken
until it reaches the shaftment and then thin out towards the end. It should next
be fletched with three feathers, one of which should be bigger than the other
two. Now shoot it, and it will fly sideways, If it does not, you can take it
that the nock is too light. Drill a hole in it then, and fill it with
lead. Shoot it again, and you will find that it flies transversely. The
advantage of this type of arrow lies in its use against birds. It will pass no
bird without hitting it’ (pp. 83-84). Arrows from Sind intended for use in this
way may be seen in the Ingo Simon Collection, Manchester Museum, No. 0.7720.

1024. According to the Mukhassas, VI, p. 51, it was a cubit.

- As applied to arrowheads, this term indicated a thin, fine head (ibid.,
  p. 58).

1025. Defined as a ‘long, broad, arrowhead’ from which the arrow took its name
(ibid.). According


to one of Ibn Sidah’s authorities, it was like a javelin-, or spear-head, while
according to another, it was a head without a raised central ridge that was
absolutely flat and smooth.
