## Translator's Comment

It goes without saying that the ability to aim is essential to accurate shooting. Although it becomes intuitive with experience, the art is not easily acquired and is indeed unattainable until and unless the archer has complete control of their bow. Methods of aiming in Islamic manuals are numerous to the exhaustion of almost all possibilities. The individual, therefore, had to make choice of method. To some extent at least, the choice would appear to have been dictated by the size and design of their bow; for the doctrine that all sighting should be ‘external’ was, we are told, that of the users of the short Khorasanian bow, while the view that it should be all ‘internal’ was held by archers who used the ‘average longer bow’ (*Tabsirah*, 65a). The method selected would also depend to some degree on factors such as style and kind of shooting (target, hunting, war, etc.).

It is more than likely that the range of methods known to Taybughā was far greater than the foregoing chapter may suggest. If he appears sparing with his knowledge, it is because of his concern with the needs of the warrior. Detetred, we suspect, by his intensely practical mind from burdening his readers with confusing prolixity, he restricts himself to what he personally regards as essential information. It is our intention, in commenting on what he has to say, to follow his example and to resist the temptation to assemble a wealth of material which, however interesting it may be, would only bewilder the general reader.

=== Monocular and Binocular Sighting

Modern teaching, like that of Taybughā, favours the use of both eyes in aiming, but nevertheless allows the closing of one if the archer finds the binocular method too difficult.

To the hunter, binocular vision is very necessary for judging range, for if one eye were to be closed throughout the draw, it is  probable that errors in elevation would result. We can, therefore, safely assert that what is applicable in the case of the hunter in this respect would be equally applicable in the case of the combatant archer.

The 'askant', or ‘squinting’, method of binocular aiming of which Taybughā thinks so highly is mentioned by the author of Arab Archery (p. 53) who does not however share his enthusiasm for it: ‘This type of aiming ... by some is supposed to be the best... In the opinion of the author, however, it is the worst and most faulty and possesses the greatest margin of error; for if the archer should close one eye and open the other and aim with it by sighting obliquely, and then should close the eye which he had left open and open the one which was closed and should aim with it, he would realize that the aim of the two eyes in this position is never the same.  How, then, could aim taken by this method be accurate?” Taybughā, however, to whom this method was obviously suited, does not assert its universal value. In fact, he clearly confines it to persons with ‘equality of vision in both eyes’.

## Sighting from the Side of the Bow

Under this head we are concerned with the lateral aspect of aim as opposed to the vertical which is related to range.

In his explanation of what is meant by the ‘outside’ and the ‘inside’ of the bow Taybughā agrees with the author of Arab Archery, who defines the latter as ‘the side toward your right . . . along which the arrow passes at the time of release’, and the former as ‘the other side which is toward your left’ (p. 52).

Given an arrow that is matched to the bow and its user and will therefore travel in the direction in which it is pointing the moment it is loosed, the line of aim may vary laterally according to three basic techniques which call for some explanation:

===Next three sections need to be indented.===

### External sighting (*an-nazar al-khārij* or *min khārij al-qaws*).

When the arrow is drawn to the ear or thereabouts, its tail, or nock, is displaced to the right of the line of sight as given by the right eye. This displacement is roughly equal to the width of the bow. This being so, the left edge of the bow must, for an accurate shot, be seen in line with the target. To aim in this way is, according'to our author's terminology, to aim ‘outside the bow’.

This method admitted of variations, and the same three variations as are mentioned by Taybugha are described in more or less detail in Arab Archery, p. 53. There the author attributes Taybughā’s third variation - his own personal preference and that in which the archer keeps his right eye on the dustār and blind to the target - to Abū Hāshim. All three variations - ‘in universal use among the kings of Persia’ - are declared suitable for archers using the oblique posture, whether seated, standing, mounted, or in armour, and are pronounced ‘very effective because of the length of the draw that is used in them’

### Internal sighting (*an-nazar ad-dākhil*, or *min dākhil al-qaws*).

When the arrow is drawn to the chin or between lip and chin its nock should lie in the vertical plane immediately beneath the right eye, and the line of sight thus run along the line of the shaft. It follows that, in this case, it is the right edge of the bow that must be aligned with the target. The archer will then be aiming ‘inside the bow’. Viewing the target according to this method is treated in *Arab Archery*, p. 54, but, to judge from the author’s comments, it had obvious disadvantages as a military technique.  Hence, no doubt, the absence of any mention of it by Taybughā.

### External-internal sighting (*qismat al-'aynayn*, ‘division of the eyes’).

When the arrow is drawn to, or near, the right-hand corner of the mouth (Le. to an intermediate position), aim must be taken between the two last and is achieved by the use of both eyes.

Both forms of the ‘split-vision’ technique mentioned in our text are dealt with by the author of *Arab Archery*, pp. 54-55. Expressing himself more clearly and in somewhat greater detial, he instructs the archer using the first method to set the upper end of the grip on a level with his nose, align the arrowhead with the target, and focus his sight on both with the left eye from outside the bow and with the right from the inside. Drawing horizontally at the level of his lips until all but a fist’s width remains, he should complete his draw with a sudden jerk and release. The method is ascribed to Ishāq. The second technique, we are told, is said to be more accurate than any other, and this is Taybughā's view, as we have seen.

===End of indentation===

A point not to be overlooked is that if the left eye is the master eye and the archer shoots right-handedly, the bow must be displaced well to the right of the target to compensate for the distance between the left eye and the nock of the arrow.

The Japanese draw roughly as far back as the point of the right shoulder and consider that the ideal aim is achieved with the left edge of thé bow running through the centre of the target. If this cannot be done, the bow may be displaced either to the right so that the target may be viewed well to the left of the bow, or to the left so that the target is obscured by the bow as viewed by the right eye.

## Gauging Elevation and Direction

In *Arab Archery*, pp. 55-56, Taybughā’s first two techniques are viewed as two variations of the method used by archers who faced the target directly.  His third technique, on the other hand, is given as one of two variations of the method used by archers who faced the target obliquely. It is recommended for warfare on the grounds that the bow could be concealed from the enemy while most of the draw was being made. When the arrowhead was a fist’s width away from full draw, it could be turned on the enemy. The second variation - not mentioned by Taybughā - differed only from the first in that aim was taken not only when the arrow had been drawn to within a fist’s width from its head, but also at the very beginning of the draw. Taybughā does not appear, however, to have shared the view that it was the ‘best method and . . . suitable for all purposes’.
