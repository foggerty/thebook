# Appendix 2 - The bow: terminalogy

In CD the various parts of a composite bow are named (C!, 21b-22b; C?, 39b-40b; C?, 154-162; D’, 16a-17a; D?, 46a-b). Many terms date from a very much earlier period than that to which the Ghunyah belongs, and we cannot be certain that all were in use in the fourteenth century. The following translation is based on C* with emendations from other MSS where the text is corrupt:

992 “A bow has five members (awal): two limbs, two siyahs, and a grip. It has four joints (mafasil): two at the junctures between the szyahs and the limbs and two at the juncture between the limbs and the grip. It has an upper section which is the one nearer the sky (i.e. when the bow is held correctly in a vertical position). Extending from the tip of the upper siyah to a point one finger’s width within the grip, it is called the shooting limb (bayt ar-ramy) because the centre which it marks (sc. at the point where it ends on the bow) is the point which the arrow passes when shot. The remaining limb is termed the dropping-limb (bayr al-isgat) or the descending-limb (bayt al-hatt) because it drops earthward when shot.

As regards the names of the various parts of the bow, the place into which the loop (‘urwah) of the bowstring fits is called the nock (farg). It is also termed by the Arabs &uzr (‘notch’) and by some Air ("lap, bosom’). The curved extremities are called siyahs. The siyah is also called by the Arabs gufr (‘finger-nail’) or 'usfür (sparrow, peg’), or fawg (‘tip, point’), or galansuzwah (‘tall cap’).® The eminence on which the knot of the bowstring rests when the bow is strung is termed 'agabah (‘acclivity’).4 The Arabs also call it utrak (‘cuticle’). The section from the base of the siyah to the grip is called bayt (‘house’, i.e. the limb).* The Persians call it dustár. The juncture between the siyah and the limb is called rukbah (‘knee’). The daffatà I-fug! are the ends of the limbs at the base of the grip. The point which the arrow passes when shot is termed kabid al-gaws ("liver, centre, of the bow’), or dimak, or niyar (‘heart’), The ibranjak is.a piece of wood in the inner surface (taf) of the grip at the point where the horn strips meet. The bone which covers the handle is called Audiid.* When a bow reverts to its reflexed position by turning backwards, it is said to be mu‘ajjirak, that is to say, ‘reverted’ (rajr ak). This term is used if the bow is relaxed (mahtatah, i.e. unbraced). When it goes back upon its belly (i.c. to the braced position) this action is called inking’ (‘bending over’).

993 a. The centre of the bow is taken to mark the end of the upper limb, which, it will be recalled, is longer than the lower. The explanation of the ‘shooting limb’ in Arab Archery, p. 14, is that the upper limb is so called “because it accounts for most of the shooting’. It is less satisfactory than the one we have here.

b. D: “it is called bayt katt al-watr’, i.e. the limb from which the string is removed, presumably when onc unbraces. C's explanation 1s based, it scems, on a misunderstanding of the meanings of hart and /sgát in this context.

994C. In Arab Archery, p. 15, the zifr (gufr), or ‘usfur), is given as the part between the nock and the

extremity of the siyah. In the Mukhassas, VI, 43, it is given as the part extending from beyond the place where the string is knotted to the end of the bow, These definitions are more appropriate than those given here.

1002. In Arab Archery, p. 15, this term is taken to mean ‘string-stopper’, but there is nothing in the Arabic to justify such a translation. The word could mean a ‘sinew-binding’, however.

. Hence bayt can mean either the entire limb, including the siyah, or only the working part of the limb,

1003. This expression normally means ‘cusps of the nock’ of an arrow. Perhaps we should read farg ‘division’ for fag, translating as ‘the sides of the division’, i.e. of the splice. The term daffah also occurs in Arab Archery, p. 15, where it is said that ‘The end of each arm adjacent to the grip, where flexibility begins, is called a daffah’.

. The reading hudüd is uncertain. The same sentence occurs in Arab Archery, p. 15, where it has been read as khudrud. No bone covering has been found in the handle of any extant Oriental composite, but such a feature does occur in Avar and Magyar types up to the tenth

1004 century A.D.  . The English-speaking archer would term this ‘following the string’.
