COMMENT

557 The foregoing chapter may well be considered the most important part of our book, for although there is no lack of eye-witness accounts of the oriental horse-archer’s skill and pro- ficiency, we know of no record of his techniques that is as detailed and instructive as that of


Taybughi.

558In MSS of the CD groups the chapter is prefaced with some brief but informative observations on mounted archery (C, 77b—78a; C*, 1215-1232; and D!, 52b-53a; D*, 76a-b, respectively C and D, in which the accounts are similar but not identical). Not surprisingly, the Turks and Turkmens (C), or the "Furkmens and Mongols (D) are named as the principal exponents from whom the horse-archers of the Middle East acquired their skills.


1. Qabag and Qighaj |

559. (2) Qabag. From the discussion in Appendix 6 it will be seen that this word denotes (i) a gourd proper; (ii) a gourd transformed into a pigeon-container and used as a target for horse- archers; (iii) an artificial gourd fashioned out of a precious metal and serving the same purpose as the preceding; (iv) a mast surmounted by any of the preceding; (v) in conjunction with the word ‘shooting’, shooting from horseback (or otherwise?) at an elevated target.

In our text ít is natural to assume that for everyday purposes the mark was an ordinary gourd.  It cannot, however, be taken for granted that the latter sufficed for ceremonial occasions, for we know from more than one source that it was a practice of Mameluke rulers to transform gourds into containers for pigeons or doves. At festivals and on high days and holidays horse-archers would vie with one another to prove their marksmanship by freeing the birds from their mast-top prisons (D). If the ‘gourd’ was of gold or silver, the successful competitor would be awarded his tatget together with a robe of honour (Appendix 6).

560Something of the history of this exercise in Mameluke times has been outlined by D. Ayalon (below, p. 78.) According to this scholar, the sport enjoyed great popularity during the first Mameluke period (A.D. 1250-1382) and was in its heyday in the sultanates of Baybars I, Qalaün and al-Ashraf Khalil, i.e. from 1260 to 1295. It was often performed on a grand scale with much pomp and ceremonial at the births and circumcisions of the sons of the sultans or grand amirs.  In the Circassian period (1382-1517), on the other hand, its popularity appears to have waned, and references to it in contemporary sources are scarce.

Although there is every reason to suppose that the exercise was introduced to the Middle

561 78 SARACEN ARCHERY


East from Central Asia where it was practised by the Turkmens (C, D), its origins cannot be traced from written sources. We, for our part, venture the hypothesis that it arose from the need to hunt birds from horseback. Birds of the right size and kind would be required not only for food, but also for feathers with which to make and repair arrows, and we may well believe the Chinese poet’s assertion that ‘Tartar chieftains shoot so well that the birds are afraid to fiy’ (Chinese Poems, tr. A. Waley, p, 128). If acceptable, the hypothesis may be pressed a stage further with the suggestion that a pole surmounted by a suitable target, perhaps a bundle of rags, would be erected near a nomad encampment so that boys might be taught the fundamentals of the art, and others afforded a valuable means of practice and amusement. Proficiency in archery can be achieved only by constant practice, and some kind of facility, however crude, must surely have been devised from the earliest times.

562From a purely military angle the main purpose of ‘gourd’ shooting must have lain in its useful- ness as a means of developing the skill and agility of the horse-archer. Some impression of the dexterity attainable may be formed from a text to which Ayalon draws attention (Scripza, Pp. 55-56). In 1293, so we are told, Amir Badr ad-Din al-Baysari devised a saddle with a very low back (that of the normal saddle would be raised; cf. Plate 14) which he used for the gourd- shooting event at one of the big festivals of the year. When he drew level with the mast and then, contrary to normal practice, passed it without having made his shot, it was thought he had lost his opportunity to shoot, but suddenly he leaned right back with his head on the horse’s rump and, shooting from a supine position, hit and broke the gourd.

The purpose of the sport is explained by Busbecq in the following terms:

563 “They [Turks of the sixteenth century] have a Custom derived from the Parthians, that they counterfeit flying away on Horseback and presently turn back and kill their unwary Pursuers.  The way they learn to do it, is this: They erect an High Pole, almost in plain Ground, with a Brass globe atop of it; about this they spur their Horses, and having got a little beyand, the Horse still Galloping, they presently turn about, and flying along, shoot an Arrow into that Globe. The frequent use hereof makes them to expect, that their Bow being turned in their flight, their unwary Enemy is shot through." (Embassy into Turkey, London, 1694, pp. 210-11.)


In Persia the Maydan-i Shah in Isfahan seems to have been an important centre for this kind of sport, for we have more than one account of the dexterity of the archers there. A French Huguenot traveller of the seventeenth century writes:

564 ‘In the midst of the piazza stands a kind of May-Pole, or Mast of a Ship, where the People exercise Shooting at Birds. When the King comes to shoot, they set a Cup of Gold upon the top of the Mast, which he is to strike down with an Arrow. To which purpose he must ride full speed, nor is he permitted to shoot till he has past the May-Pole, rurning himself upon the crupper of his Horse . . . The Cup belongs to him that strikes it down; and I have seen Sha- Seft...in five Courses strike down three Cups...’ (Quoted by E. Crawshay Williams, fom Persia, London, 1907, pp. 281-82. For a similar account, see Sir John Chardin’s Travels, » p. 200.)


With variations in the nature of the target (melon, arpus, apple, trencher filled with small Silver coin, criminals under death sentence, heads of rebels, etc.) the game is frequently men- tioned by European travellers, The height of the mast probably varied, but it is given by one writer as ‘some twenty-five feer’. (F. B. Bradley-Birt, Through Persia from the Gulf to the Caspian, London, 1909, pp. 266-67.)

565(b) Qighaj. In the present context this term (see Appendix 6) may denote: (i) an exercise in which an archer, shooting parallel with his left thigh, directs his shot at a ground target; (ii) any kind of shooting from horseback in which the target is so situated as to require the archer to shoot downwards; (iii) the target at which either of the preceding is directed.


ON SHOOTING FROM HORSEBACK 79

566 Nothingissaidin our textabout the nature of the mark, but the view that it may have been a butt made of a wicker basket filled with sand (below, p. 173) is not unreasonable. The possibility that the term gighaj denoted other targets of a similar kind should not, however, be excluded. Hansard.  __without an accurate reference-—quotes an eye-witness account of a display outside Cairo in the sixteenth (?) century which records that ‘on one side were three artificial hillocks of sand, about fifty paces distant one from the other, and on the summit of cach stood a spear and a banner, being marks destined for the archers’ (Book of Archery, pp. 34-36). Busbecq describes an ordinary Turkish butt as being a bank of sandy, gravelly earth, four feet from the ground and formed with boards (op. cit., p. 206). (See also Plate IO.)

Although Taybughà makes no direct reference to the range at which the target was engaged in the gighaj exercise (sense (i) above), an archer shooting parallel with his left thigh and half standing in his stirrups with a slight forward lean would, we suggest, have had his mark almost directly beneath his left knee at the moment of loosing. The practical value of this form of shoot- ing is obvious, and it is almost otiose to point out its direct relevance to hunting and warfare.  From a military standpoint the ability to engage an awkwardly situated ground target would be an essential qualification in a horse-archer. It is easy to envisage a situation, for instance, in which the mounted warrior in the heat of battle suddenly comes at full tilt upon an enemy, perhaps just unhorsed and either lying on the ground or in the act of rising lmost beneath the hooves of the onrushing horse, With a loaded bow and no time to switch to sword or mace the man on horseback could only dispatch his foe with a quick shot at an awkward angle. The essential purpose of gighaj shooting, therefore, would certainly be to train archers to kill under every possible condition in combat.

567Between the rwo forms of shooting, gighaj and gabag, there was, so Taybughá tells us, a third, by which, assuming that the first two are directed almost vertically downward and upward, he must mean shooting in a horizontal, or nearly horizontal, plane. The classification is not a pedantic superfluity, for, whereas considerable contortion is needed to be able to shoot either almost directly downwards or upwards, the body is tolerably erect when the shooting is horizontal.  If an archer could shoot accurately both upwards and downwards, any shot that was roughly horizontal would have seemed relatively simple.


2. Reins and Accoutrements

568 (a) Sirifsar, ‘martingale’. The word is undoubtedly a borrowing from the Persian sar-afsár, which is nebulously explained in Persian dictionaries as a kind of headstall, or as the head of the reins, meaning that part which is taken into the hands, and so on (e.g. Farhang-i Nafisi and Steingass, s.v.), In our text we have an unambiguous definition. On the other hand, we are not told exactly what kind of martingale was used for the purpose in question. Under certain condi- tions in which a horse might stumble, a running martingale will allow the animal to lift its head sufficiently to recover its balance, whereas a standing martingale could be a serious impediment.  The need for a martingale was evidently considered by some to be a particularly bad fault in à horse-archer's mount (C1, 78b; C^, 1243).

After examining a large number of miniature paintings we have found only one certain depiction of a martingale for the fourteenth century (A. Sakisian, La miniature persane, Paris, 1929, Fig. 31, p. xxii École Mongole, commencement du xive siècle}. This, like those daung from about the sixteenth century, presents the appearance of a standing martingale.

569(b) Musta'án, ‘aid’. This is a technical term which, in the sense it has in our text, is not recorded in any Arabic dictionary known to us. The translation we adopt is based on a literal rendering, viz. ‘that to which recourse is had for help’. According to one definition, the aid was a fine leather strap which was about two spans long—presumably when folded, though it is by no means certain that it was always a loop as indicated in our text. It was used by some archers, but not


So SAKACEN ARCHERY

570 others, according to personal preference (C1, 79a; C$, 1242-b). Leather, it would seem, was not an essential material; cord would do equally well (B, et ai.).

(c) Mahbas, ‘retainer’, According to our text this item was worn on the ring-finger to enable the archer to retain his reins while shooting. It is, perhaps, not commonly realized that control ofa horse is virtually lost when the reins are dropped. It has been modern cavalry practice to train the horse to follow a straight course under these circumstances, and there would seem to be cvery reason to suppose that mounted warriors in past ages would adopt the same policy. To regain control the archer must recover his reins as rapidly as possible.

571While it is clear from our various MSS that the ‘retainer’ was a ring of some kind, there are

ifferences of detail in the definitions given. According to one explanation, it was both (i) a ring tied into the reins beneath the rein-knot, presumably to accommodate the aid, and (ii) a ring used for the purpose described in our text (Ct, 79b; C?, 125b; cf. D1, 54b; D4, 77b). Elsewhere it is defined as a ring designed to slip over the top end of the loop formed by the aid to make a smaller loop which would accommodate the ting-finger (a, sra).

572 3. Forms of Shooting from Horseback


From the text, as it stands, it is not easy to discern which are the ten forms of shooting ftom horseback declared to be basic, or to conjecture with any hope of certainty which are the seven- teen of our author, The matter is further complicated by the fact that in the MSS of groups C

573 Is a form basic because of the direction in which a shot can be made? In other words, is it basic because it is vital to the attainment of the maximum field within which the archer can effectively operate? Or is it basic because of technique and posture? Or, finally, is it basic by reason of 2 combination of all such factors,

While it is not intended to embark upon an unprofitable enumeration of classifications that may be developed on the foundations implied by our questions, it is at the same time appropriate to point out that direction does not always demand a fundamental change in posture. In certain situations the archer’s posture may remain virtually unchanged even though the directions in

574 not shoot the gourd while sitting upright in his saddle by merely raising the bow-hand above his head. On the other hand, to shoot downwards at long range would not require a posture funda- mentally different from that used for shooting in a roughly horizontal plane.

To those for whom esoteric interpretations have no appeal one solution that may commend itself is as follows:

575 - To left flank, forward and downward parallel with thigh (gighaj),

. To left flank, forward and upward (qabaq).

576- In horizontal plane (target roughly level with left shoulder).

. Ahead with bow, upper limb to right, canted above horse’s neck.

577- To right flank, forward and downward.

- To left flank rear, upward or downward, with bow canted over horsc's croup. - Fo left flank rear, upward or downward, with bow vertical.

578. Jarmaki of two kinds, each with four shots.

. Beneath horse's neck from right to left.

579- Beneath horse’s neck from left to right.

581 Shots 6 and 7 executed on the right-hand side may reasonably be discounted either as variations or as forms of shooting too difficult to be considered basic. Unless the shooter was ambidexterous —and nowhere is there any suggestion that horse-archers were trained to be so—such shots would certainly be most difficult. For possible alternatives to 8, 9, and 10, see J. D. Latham, ‘Notes on Mamlük Horse-archers', in BSOAS XXXII, 1969, pp. 265-66.

For the sake of comparison, which will afford the reader an opportunity of evaluating additional or discrepant details contained in them (italicized below), we have thought it worth while to précis in the following composite account the versions contained in groups C and D (C3, 83b- 86b; C, 131b-136b; D!, 58a-60b; D*, 79b-81b; portions occurring in D, but not in C, are indicated in parentheses):

582The ways in which an arrow may be shot amount to fifteen and have to do more particularly with shooting at a ground target (gighaj). An archer may shoot downwards parallel with his

left thigh—this is gighas—or upwards, which kind of shooting is called gabag . . . The rider may turn his chest to the right, canting the upper limb of his bow across the horse's neck with the arrowhead above its right ear. The bow may also be canted with the lower limb across the horse's neck, and this will also make three (shots? Up, down, horizontal?). Thus, the archer wil] be able to strike a mortal blow against an enemy in front of him either at short range or long, For this kind of shooting he would do well to have not less than 10 cubits (about 6 yards) between himself and his target.

585To shoot right in front of his horse, he should first draw and hold and, tilting the lower limb of his bow across the animal’s neck, transfer it to his right side. To do this, he should bring up the lower part of his right thigh on to the saddle and turn his left until the front of it comes against the saddle as it presses against the stirrup next to the horse's belly. (D: Some shoot at the mark as soon as the horse’s head draws level with i.)

To shoot at a target to his rear, the archer should easily and without straining or forcing turn to the left from his waist and draw his bow at an angle across his horse's croup. He may also shoot with the bow in a vertical position. Both methods can be used to shoot upwards or downwards and at short or long range. (D: The shot is made when the croup is in line with the mark.) This gives four kinds of rear Shot, and two more at the horizontal will bring the number uD to six, Then there are two more on the right side, one immediately over the right thigh and the other to the left of it, bat to shoot in this way is difficult. [We emend here, reading ‘asir ‘difficult’ for ‘askr ‘ten’, with which the subject matter has undoubtedly been made to accord, ]

586For another kind of shot to the rear the archer, after drawing and holding, may bring his right hand up over his head, tuck his head in beneath his right wrist so that his hand rests in the nape of his neck. This technique will enable him to engage a target close by the right or left thigh of his mount, By bringing round his bow-haad once his right hand is anchored in the nape of his neck, he can shoot forward and dowaward to either side; for by bringing his bow round over his horse’s neck he can shoot down in front of his right knee. This form of shooting is called jarmakt, The technique can be varied by holding the bow, as yet undrawn, with the string on the outside of the left forearm. Bringing the grip of his bow to the nape, the archer can then nock and lock on his right shoulder. He can nock while his left hand grips the reins, raise both arms, tuck in his head under the right forearm, draw, and shoot in the four ways already described, ie. two to fore and two to rear.

Finally, the archer can shoot to left or right under the horse’s neck. These two methods complete the fifteen. Here the archer draws and holds, then bends his left arm to shoot under the neck from one side to the other. This kind of shot requires him to discard the martingale and lean over slightly. It needs a good deal of practice. This completes the basic ways of shooting; secondary ways are legion.

587 As in the case of our own text we are confronted with the problem of deciding which forms of shooting are considered basic and, again, it is a matter of conjecture. Under these circumstances it is best to leave the question open.


4. Jarmaki (?): the Term and the Technique

588 Almost all MSS give this term as Jarmaki, jarmuki or the like, which immediately suggests a relative adjective derived from Çermik or Cermük in the province of Diyarbakir in modern Turkey, but we tentatively propose that the word be regarded as the Arabic adjectival form of the Turkish adjective çarpık ( >jarbak>jarmak) ‘awry’, i.e. deviating from the line of sight, Such a term makes excellent sense, for, by anchoring the drawing hand in the nape of the neck, the line of the arrow is displaced, albeit deliberately, to the left of the line of sight in order to


ON SHOOTING FROM HORSEBACK 83

589 shoot at a target unattainable by means of the normal draw to the chin or side of the face.

Practical trials show that a modern Western archer not trained in this method of shooting from boyhood will not find it easy. If the bow is drawn in the normal way with the string inside the arm, the weapon has to be tilted to enable a full draw to be achieved. With the string outside it is difficult to avoid hitting the elbow on loosing. How any accuracy can be achieved is another problem. Basically, an archer draws to the face so that he can orientate his shot by looking along the arrow. As the jarmaki technique results in a relatively large lateral displacement of the arrow from the line of sight, shooting by this method must be purely instinctive, and skilful application can, it is clear, only be achieved by considerable practice and experience.

590The advantage of the technique is that it increases the lateral angle over which a horse-archer can engage a target. By way of example, let us suppose that an enemy appears about 20° to the right of the direction in which the archer is riding, and, for some reason, he cannot, or does not wish to, turn to the right to engage. By rising slightly in his stirrups, putting his weight on the left foot, and twisting his body to the right so as to bring his right thigh over the top of the saddle, he can shoot in the normal manner, drawing to the face. When he reaches the limit to which he can turn his body in this way, but still needs to extend the arc over which he can shoot because his target lies to the right of that limit, he can do so by drawing behind the neck as described and artificially deflecting the line of his arrow to the right. Apart from enabling a horseman to engage targets over a wider arc, the jarmaki technique is of definite merit for shooting at very close range when the rider is almost immediately above his target. Similarly it could be applied by an archer standing at the top of a fortress and shooting at an enemy at the base of the wall (below, p. 137)-

Some brief mention is made of this form of shooting by de Bertier, Cordier, and Guglielmini in Le tir à Parc (Paris, 1900), pp. 9-10, where it is stated, contrary to the information supplied by Taybughà, that the string must of necessity lie outside the left arm. Attention is drawn to the support afforded the drawing hand by the neck which allows the use of a very powerful bow, and the view is taken by the authors that the horseman’s position favours this kind of shooting which is the only easy way of engaging a target to the rear. What is most interesting from our point of view is the statement on the authority of a contemporary traveller that the technique was still used in Turkestan where he had several times seen it applied by riders of his escort. The informant had observed that the horsemen of Turkestan showed great skill in using either hand to shoot a bow in this way.

591A point worth mentioning here, not because it is in any way connected with the jarmaki technique, but because it calls for comment too brief for separate treatment, is the difficulty of shooting under a horse’s neck. How the bow could fail to strike the horse when the arrow was loosed is almost beyond our comprehension.


5. Birjas

592‘The birdjas game’, writes Ayalon, ‘is often referred to [in Mameluke historical sources], but without any particulars whatsoever’ (op. cit., p. 56). Vocalized as birjas, burjás, or barjás, the term is variously defined by almost all the lexicographers as (a) ‘a game, similar to that called jarid, in which mounted players combated or pursued each other throwing sticks’ (Dozy, s.v.); (b) “a butt to shoot at, especially elevated high in the air’ (Steingass, s.v.); (c) ‘a mark to shoot at (Redhouse s.v.). In our text the term denotes something resembling a hoop on a spear. That it was such is undoubtedly true, for some account of an exercise called the ‘birjds charge’ is to be found in a sixteenth-century Paris MS in which the point is confirmed (Bibliothèque Nationale, Arabe 2,826: Kitáb al-makhzün jámi' al-funün, 104a-b). In this the cavalryman, having set a hoop by means of a wooden truck on top of a short lance, charges and, engaging the target on his left, aims to snatch up the hoop with the end of his full-length ‘candle-form’ lance. How the term


-z YERINILU GIN ADUCEA 1 comes to denote ‘a mark to shoot at in Persian and Turkish can easily be understood both from our text and from other references to archers’ shooting through rings used in lance exercises (e.g. Hansard, Book of Archery, p. 121). The definition recorded by Blachére (Dict., s.v.) is, therefore, correct.
