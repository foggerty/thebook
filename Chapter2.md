# 2 - The Pillars of archery

Successful shooting hinges on accuracy, the infliction of injury, the ability to strike from a distance, the ability to strike swiftly, and the ability to protect one's own body.)

These five points are the pillars (*arkān*) on which archery rests, and the true archer is he whose mastery of them is complete, They are interdependent in the same way as five entities vital to archery are interdependent, namely, the bow, the string, the arrow, the thumb-guard and the archer, [That such is the case is clear from the reasoning which follows]. Should a man’s arrow be true to the mark but be harmless, it would be ineffective. Conversely, should his arrow be capable of inflicting injury but not true to the mark, it would be of no avail. Should the arrow be both true to the mark and also capable of inflicting injury but the archer fail to protect himself adequately against his foe, the latter may kill him. Again, should accuracy, the ability to injure, and the skill to afford oneself adequate protection all be present at the same time, but speed be lacking, the archer’s adversary will very likely take flight and his quarry elude him because of slowness in shooting. Finally, should all the four conditions which we have mentioned be satisfied without the archer’s keeping well away from the foe, his antagonist will possibly take him unawares and slay him. It is in fact only because archery can be used at a distance from the enemy that it has come to be regarded as superior to all other means of warfare. For the longer the range from which the archer can shoot, the greater the harm he can do his enemy [with correspondingly less risk to his own safety].
