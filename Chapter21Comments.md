COMMENT I. The List of Faults and Injuries

768 Dreary reading though it may be, a methodical list of faults and injuries such as that arranged above is useful to the archer who lacks the tutored eye of a master to spot the cause of some injury or misplaced shot. To check each of the possible causes of his trouble against the list would be a relatively simple task which could be followed by attempts to remedy the fault.

As in the case of the previous chapter, Mustafa Kani produces a list closely resembling that of Taybughd, but, again, because of his preoccupation with Ottoman flight shooting and the need to take into account the use of the thumb-ring, muskamma', and siper, his treatment of the subject does diifer in certain respects (Isl., XV, pp. 237-40). It might justly be argued that Taybugha would have done well to comment here on the effects of ill-fitting thumb-guards, for although be himself would appear to have shot with a bare thumb (above, p. 34), he is clearly aware, a$ we have already seen in Ch, 6, that many archers need such protection. In CD the omission is in fact made good (C!, 65a-66a; C?, ro4b-ro5b; C3, 54b-55b; D}, 47b-482; D, 71b). Here we are told that a guard that is too tight or has too long a lip will split the thumb-nail, and that when the thumb is bent, it will, if the guard is too tight, suffer constriction and go black, or its pad will turn blue, or eise it will be rapped by the string.

769 2. Injuries to the Drawing Hand


Without complete mastery of the thumb-lock it is difficult to appreciate fully some of the finer points of a subject in which it is largely a question of fractional deviations in the relative positions of the thumb and index finger. There can nevertheless be no doubt that what suits one hand may ' not suit another, and that results are the only true criterion of right and wrong. When learning the — Oriental technique, the archer must bear this in mind and patiently experiment until he finds by sheer trial and error the position most suited to his needs. What is clear and at the same time universally applicable is that the thumb must be firmly lodged against the middle phalanx of the middle finger. Otherwise, there will be—in the author's own words-—‘nothing under the thumb to hold it in check’ (p. 118).

770A fault liable to cause splits down the nail results from twisting the side of the thumb upwards (Fig. 41). With his thumb in this position the archer is also liable to pinch the nock of his arrow and allow his index finger to exert undue pressure on the tail, A number of iliustrations which have so far appeared in various publications show thumb-locks that are faulty by Taybugha’s teaching. M. E. Elott, for instance, presents as the Korean lock what we style ‘wrong’ in our Fig. 41 (‘Technique of the Oriental Release’, Archery, Dec. 1962, p. 18). Since this author studied under a Korean instructor, it may well be that the Koreans’ view on the subject differs from that of our author, Alternatively, it could be that the latter means not so much that the lock in question is wrong as that it is conducive to the commission of certain errors. Again, both Elott and R.  Willcox curl the tip of the index finger around the thumb (Elott, ibid., and R. Willcox, ‘Some- thing about the Thumb Ring’, TAM, Nov. 1962, p. 16). In spite of our author's warning that it is a fault that will result in spasm (kuzzdz; above, p. 51), Willcox nevertheless appears to find it no impediment to successful shooting. Technically more orthodox by our standards, on the other


120 SARACEN ARCHERY

771 hand, is the lock illustrated by Faris and Elmer, though the position of the thumb-tip, which rests against the joint of the middle finger instead of the phalanx, leaves room for criticism. (Mis- interpretation of the Arabic ‘ugdak as ‘joint’, a sense which it usually has, may account for the error). i

Fic. 41, TWISTING THE THUMB

773 3. ‘Inversion of the Cupping-point’


This is clearly the fault whereby the left elbow, as viewed by the archer with arm outstretched, is allowed to twist round in an anti-clockwise direction. The result of the fault is that the point of the elbow drops from the horizontal, and the arm curves inwards towards the path of the string with the consequent danger of its being hit. The prominent vein (termed the ‘basilic’) which runs from the bend of the elbow upwards along the inner side of the upper arm may well burst open under the impact. The basilic vein is generally that opened for biood-letting, hence the reference to the ‘cupping-point’.

774 4. The Internal Draw


Rapping, by which is meant the action of the bowstring in striking some part of the person, is caused by (8) the encroachment of any part of the body upon the path of the string, and (b) what the author terms the internal draw (al-madd al-juwwäni). The second of these two causes requires some explanation. What happens is that the archer, instead of drawing the string directly to his face, first draws it closely along the inside of his left arm and then sharply deflects the path of his drawing hand outwards across his face. With a tight grip such as he should have on the handle he is sure, in this event, to put a twist into his bow, Consequently, the string, when loosed, will not only travel forward, but it will also spring over to the left and thus be liable to strike the arm or wrist.

775In passing we may mention that with the Mediterranean loose, or three-finger draw, used by most of the old European bowmen as well as by modern Western archers, the wrist is commonly struck. For this reason a bracer, or arm-guard, should always be worn as the arm may be lightly hit even when a shot is correctly executed. With the thumb-lock, on the other hand, a bracer is not needed since the arm is never struck unless therc is some fault in technique.


5. Sounds Emitted by Equipment

776 The variant reading taswit as-sahkm (‘emission of sound by the arrow’) for our tasteib as-sahm (p. 116) poses the problem of deciding which of the two' is more acceptable. Prima facie, the former seems preferable to the latter, especially since we would normally expect taswib as-sakm to mean ‘directing the arrow straight at the mark’, a sense which it clearly cannot have in the


ON FAULTS & INJURIES TO WHICH ARCHERS ARE EXPOSED 121

777 context. But what sounds are emitted by an arrow? There is only one sound, and that is produced when the shaftment strikes the arrow-pass as it leaves the bow, the cause being either the use of unsuitable or defective equipment, or an error on the part of the archer. More precisely, it is caused by ‘twisting the grip on loosing, a bad grasp, pinching the nock’ or by ‘too big a loop, or a bad arrow that is defective either because it is too thin or of too weak a wood or roughly cut in the making’ (C!, 66a-b; C?, 1o6a-b; C*, 555—562, ctc.). Practical trials so far completed suggest that the archer’s errors said by our author to result in raswib as-sahm do not result in the emission of any sound, but rather in low flight. We therefore retain tagwib and take the expression to mean ‘causing the arrow to fly low" (from lack of initial velocity) on the basis of the senses ‘to lower’, as of the head, and ‘to descend’ indicated for forms II and V respectively of the Arabic root from which tagzi derives.


6. ‘Predominance’ of the Lower Limb

778 ‘Predominance of the leg of the bow’ (p. 118) is the best translation we can offer of the words qiyàm rij! al-qaws. It is a difficult expression with which Faris and Elmer had also to come to grips (Arab Archery, p. 72, n. 29). The sense, on the other hand, seems to be fairly clear. The implication is that the lower limb of the bow 3s the stronger. Under these circumstances the lower limb travels faster than rhe upper when the bow is loosed, and at the instant the arrow leaves the string the nock is too low in relation to the thumb of the bow-hand, thereby causing the shaft—propelled by uneven thrust—to rub too much against the thumb. A composite bow can develop such a fault even though both limbs were correctly balanced at the time of manu- facture. It can be easily corrected by heat treatment (above, p. 99), as we have proved by


experiment.

779 CHAPTER 22 ON ADJUSTMENTS Injuries sustained by archers fall into five groups: 1. Rapping ‘of parts of the body with the bowstring! (targ); 2. Blistering (‘agr); 3. Splitting "of skin and nails! (shagg); 4. Tremor (érti‘ash); 5. Blue bruising (zurgah).

738 Rapping occurs in eight places: 1. The wrist (left);

746 Six faults and mishaps result from all this: 1. Wagging of the arrow in flight; 2. Diminished accuracy; 3. Reduced effectiveness; 4. Loss of range; 5. A snapped bowstring; 6. A cut sleeve.


Rapping of the Veft! upper arm arises from five errors: I. Inversion of the cupping-point (ingilab al-fisád;? below, p- 120); 2. The internal draw; 3. Squatting obliquely; 4. Lifting the shoulders.

747 Four faults can result from this: I. Low flight (taszib as-sahm); 2. Diminished accuracy;

749 ON FAULTS & INJURIES TO WHICH ARCHERS ARE EXPOSED 117


Rapping of the right check arises from three errors:

7501. Bending the neck sideways;

2. Overdrawing (in the sense indicated above);

7513. Squatting obliquely in the case of an archer with a short neck; for when such a person adopts this position and draws, he inclines his head, and the bowstring strikes his cheek, especially if he has a scanty beard. A short-necked person should not, therefore, sit obliquely (Ch. 22). A squatting position directly facing the mark is the only position suitable for such a person.


Rapping of the chin[beard arises from six errors: - I. Squatting obliquely in the case of an archer with a short neck; 2. The internal draw; _.'3. Too long an arrow; 4. Tensing the neck; 5. Tensing the waist; 6. Too strong a bow.

752 Rapping of the nipple arises from four causes: 1. Squatting obliquely; 2, The internal draw!;* 3. Close proximity of the bowstring to the chest; 4. Excessive dropping of the right! elbow.


Rapping of the right index finger arises from two causes: I, Tensing it on the thumb at the draw; 2. Its being slack at the loose. Any person with long fingers should keep his right finger away from the bowstring (i.e. to the right of it).

753 Rapping of the thumb arises from rwo faults: I. The tip of the thumb being held limply on the middle phalanx of the middie finger at the draw; 2. A sluggish loose.


Blistering of the fingers of the left hand arises from four causes:

7541. Slackness of the grip-fingers;

2. Too thin a grip;

7553. Grasping incorrectly;

4. The flesh on the palm gathering up under ‘pressure from! the belly and the matn; for when one looses.and follows through with a forward and downward thrust and the grip pinches” the flesh of one’s fingers, it results in diminished accuracy, reduced effectiveness, and loss of range.

756 Blistering of that part of the thumb which guides the arrow (majrd) arises from eight errors:


r. Pinching the nock (kkang al-káz) and pressing too heavily on the nockpiece (kabb ‘ala

757 Lfüg; below, p. 120); . Downward displacement of the nocking-point; . Drawing upwards and loosing downwards; . Too wide a nock; . Too narrow a nock;

758 II$ SARACEN ARCHERY


6. Too square a grasp (so that the wrist is brought too far round to the right) and tension of the thumb; ; 7. Predominance, and consequent distortion, of the leg of the bow (because of its greater

759 strength);


8. A crooked arrow.?*

760 Splits across the thumb-nail arise from four causes: 1. Having the thumb slack when drawing, and fastening the right index finger over its tip; 2, The tip of the thumb being off the middle finger; 3. Locking with the tip; 4. Releasing the thumb before the right index finger. This fault can be eliminated by loosing with the right index finger without opening the thumb "until afterwards?!.


1 Splits down the nail’ arise from five causes: 1. Opening the little finger;

761. Having nothing under the thumb to hold it in check;?

. Freeing the bowstring under the distal phalanx of the thumb; -

762. Fastening the tip of the right index finger on the thumb;

. Twisting the side of the thumb upwards, thus causing wear and tear on the side of the nail with resultant splitting. The fault may be corrected by tensing the three appropriate fingers, placing the tip of the thumb on the middle phalanx of the middle finger where it should be held straight and tense, relaxing the right index finger, and releasing with the latter before the thumb.!

763 maw N


Blue bruising of the pad of the thumb arises from two causes: 1. Its being rapped by the bowstring; 2. Its being left too free.

764 Blue bruising of the tip of the right index finger arises from the following cause: Loosing with the finger bent with the result that it is caught by the string when loosed, This fault can be eliminated by keeping the index finger outside (Le. to the right of) the bowstring when locking.


Blue bruising under the nail arises from four causes: 1. Shortness of the fingers; 2, A relaxed thumb on the middle finger; 3. Putting only the very tip (ratrif) of the index finger on the thumb; 4. Tensing the index finger over the tip of the thumb.

765 Tremor arises from two causes: T. Relaxation of the elbows and shoulder-blades; 2. Tension in the neck.


The elimination of all these faults and their attendant ills can be achieved by the application of reverse procedures. Thus, if tension in any part of the body is the cause of the trouble, relaxa- tion is the remedy, and if relaxation is the cause, tension is the cure. If an oblique squatung position (qu'ud at-tahrif) is the cause, the mark should be faced directly. If too strong a bow is the cause, the archer must shoot a bow to match his capacity, and if an arrow is too long for him, he should draw only as much of it as his limbs will take, and so on.

766There is no mystery about this sort of thing, and so, for the sake of brevity, we have not always


ON FAULTS & INJURIES TO WHICH ARCHERS ARE EXPOSED 119

767 indicated the remedy for cach fault as it has arisen. All an archer need do is to follow faithfully the advice contained in our poem (above, p. 4) since it incorporates all the good advice he needs, and those who turn to it for guidance and put its counsels into practice will acquire nothing but good habits and immunity from the faults and injuries mentioned above. I have in fact only dealt with the subject by way of supplementing my commentary.


COMMENT I. The List of Faults and Injuries

768 Dreary reading though it may be, a methodical list of faults and injuries such as that arranged above is useful to the archer who lacks the tutored eye of a master to spot the cause of some injury or misplaced shot. To check each of the possible causes of his trouble against the list would be a relatively simple task which could be followed by attempts to remedy the fault.

As in the case of the previous chapter, Mustafa Kani produces a list closely resembling that of Taybughd, but, again, because of his preoccupation with Ottoman flight shooting and the need to take into account the use of the thumb-ring, muskamma', and siper, his treatment of the subject does diifer in certain respects (Isl., XV, pp. 237-40). It might justly be argued that Taybugha would have done well to comment here on the effects of ill-fitting thumb-guards, for although be himself would appear to have shot with a bare thumb (above, p. 34), he is clearly aware, a$ we have already seen in Ch, 6, that many archers need such protection. In CD the omission is in fact made good (C!, 65a-66a; C?, ro4b-ro5b; C3, 54b-55b; D}, 47b-482; D, 71b). Here we are told that a guard that is too tight or has too long a lip will split the thumb-nail, and that when the thumb is bent, it will, if the guard is too tight, suffer constriction and go black, or its pad will turn blue, or eise it will be rapped by the string.

Having the thumb slack when drawing, and fastening the right index finger over its tip; 2, The tip of the thumb being off the middle finger; 3. Locking with the tip; 4. Releasing the thumb before the right index finger. This fault can be eliminated by loosing with the right index finger without opening the thumb "until afterwards?!.

. Freeing the bowstring under the distal phalanx of the thumb; -

762. Fastening the tip of the right index finger on the thumb;

. Twisting the side of the thumb upwards, thus causing wear and tear on the side of the nail with resultant splitting. The fault may be corrected by tensing the three appropriate fingers, placing the tip of the thumb on the middle phalanx of the middle finger where it should be held straight and tense, relaxing the right index finger, and releasing with the latter before the thumb.!

Blue bruising of the pad of the thumb arises from two causes: 1. Its being rapped by the bowstring; 2. Its being left too free.

764 Blue bruising of the tip of the right index finger arises from the following cause: Loosing with the finger bent with the result that it is caught by the string when loosed, This fault can be eliminated by keeping the index finger outside (Le. to the right of) the bowstring when locking.


Blue bruising under the nail arises from four causes: 1. Shortness of the fingers; 2, A relaxed thumb on the middle finger; 3. Putting only the very tip (ratrif) of the index finger on the thumb; 4. Tensing the index finger over the tip of the thumb.

765 Tremor arises from two causes: T. Relaxation of the elbows and shoulder-blades; 2. Tension in the neck.


The elimination of all these faults and their attendant ills can be achieved by the application of reverse procedures. Thus, if tension in any part of the body is the cause of the trouble, relaxa- tion is the remedy, and if relaxation is the cause, tension is the cure. If an oblique squatung position (qu'ud at-tahrif) is the cause, the mark should be faced directly. If too strong a bow is the cause, the archer must shoot a bow to match his capacity, and if an arrow is too long for him, he should draw only as much of it as his limbs will take, and so on.

766There is no mystery about this sort of thing, and so, for the sake of brevity, we have not always


ON FAULTS & INJURIES TO WHICH ARCHERS ARE EXPOSED 119

767 indicated the remedy for cach fault as it has arisen. All an archer need do is to follow faithfully the advice contained in our poem (above, p. 4) since it incorporates all the good advice he needs, and those who turn to it for guidance and put its counsels into practice will acquire nothing but good habits and immunity from the faults and injuries mentioned above. I have in fact only dealt with the subject by way of supplementing my commentary.


COMMENT I. The List of Faults and Injuries

768 Dreary reading though it may be, a methodical list of faults and injuries such as that arranged above is useful to the archer who lacks the tutored eye of a master to spot the cause of some injury or misplaced shot. To check each of the possible causes of his trouble against the list would be a relatively simple task which could be followed by attempts to remedy the fault.

As in the case of the previous chapter, Mustafa Kani produces a list closely resembling that of Taybughd, but, again, because of his preoccupation with Ottoman flight shooting and the need to take into account the use of the thumb-ring, muskamma', and siper, his treatment of the subject does diifer in certain respects (Isl., XV, pp. 237-40). It might justly be argued that Taybugha would have done well to comment here on the effects of ill-fitting thumb-guards, for although be himself would appear to have shot with a bare thumb (above, p. 34), he is clearly aware, a$ we have already seen in Ch, 6, that many archers need such protection. In CD the omission is in fact made good (C!, 65a-66a; C?, ro4b-ro5b; C3, 54b-55b; D}, 47b-482; D, 71b). Here we are told that a guard that is too tight or has too long a lip will split the thumb-nail, and that when the thumb is bent, it will, if the guard is too tight, suffer constriction and go black, or its pad will turn blue, or eise it will be rapped by the string.

769 2. Injuries to the Drawing Hand


Without complete mastery of the thumb-lock it is difficult to appreciate fully some of the finer points of a subject in which it is largely a question of fractional deviations in the relative positions of the thumb and index finger. There can nevertheless be no doubt that what suits one hand may ' not suit another, and that results are the only true criterion of right and wrong. When learning the — Oriental technique, the archer must bear this in mind and patiently experiment until he finds by sheer trial and error the position most suited to his needs. What is clear and at the same time universally applicable is that the thumb must be firmly lodged against the middle phalanx of the middle finger. Otherwise, there will be—in the author's own words-—‘nothing under the thumb to hold it in check’ (p. 118).

770A fault liable to cause splits down the nail results from twisting the side of the thumb upwards (Fig. 41). With his thumb in this position the archer is also liable to pinch the nock of his arrow and allow his index finger to exert undue pressure on the tail, A number of iliustrations which have so far appeared in various publications show thumb-locks that are faulty by Taybugha’s teaching. M. E. Elott, for instance, presents as the Korean lock what we style ‘wrong’ in our Fig. 41 (‘Technique of the Oriental Release’, Archery, Dec. 1962, p. 18). Since this author studied under a Korean instructor, it may well be that the Koreans’ view on the subject differs from that of our author, Alternatively, it could be that the latter means not so much that the lock in question is wrong as that it is conducive to the commission of certain errors. Again, both Elott and R.  Willcox curl the tip of the index finger around the thumb (Elott, ibid., and R. Willcox, ‘Some- thing about the Thumb Ring’, TAM, Nov. 1962, p. 16). In spite of our author's warning that it is a fault that will result in spasm (kuzzdz; above, p. 51), Willcox nevertheless appears to find it no impediment to successful shooting. Technically more orthodox by our standards, on the other


120 SARACEN ARCHERY

771 hand, is the lock illustrated by Faris and Elmer, though the position of the thumb-tip, which rests against the joint of the middle finger instead of the phalanx, leaves room for criticism. (Mis- interpretation of the Arabic ‘ugdak as ‘joint’, a sense which it usually has, may account for the error). i

773 3. ‘Inversion of the Cupping-point’


This is clearly the fault whereby the left elbow, as viewed by the archer with arm outstretched, is allowed to twist round in an anti-clockwise direction. The result of the fault is that the point of the elbow drops from the horizontal, and the arm curves inwards towards the path of the string with the consequent danger of its being hit. The prominent vein (termed the ‘basilic’) which runs from the bend of the elbow upwards along the inner side of the upper arm may well burst open under the impact. The basilic vein is generally that opened for biood-letting, hence the reference to the ‘cupping-point’.

774 4. The Internal Draw


Rapping, by which is meant the action of the bowstring in striking some part of the person, is caused by (8) the encroachment of any part of the body upon the path of the string, and (b) what the author terms the internal draw (al-madd al-juwwäni). The second of these two causes requires some explanation. What happens is that the archer, instead of drawing the string directly to his face, first draws it closely along the inside of his left arm and then sharply deflects the path of his drawing hand outwards across his face. With a tight grip such as he should have on the handle he is sure, in this event, to put a twist into his bow, Consequently, the string, when loosed, will not only travel forward, but it will also spring over to the left and thus be liable to strike the arm or wrist.

775In passing we may mention that with the Mediterranean loose, or three-finger draw, used by most of the old European bowmen as well as by modern Western archers, the wrist is commonly struck. For this reason a bracer, or arm-guard, should always be worn as the arm may be lightly hit even when a shot is correctly executed. With the thumb-lock, on the other hand, a bracer is not needed since the arm is never struck unless therc is some fault in technique.


5. Sounds Emitted by Equipment

776 The variant reading taswit as-sahkm (‘emission of sound by the arrow’) for our tasteib as-sahm (p. 116) poses the problem of deciding which of the two' is more acceptable. Prima facie, the former seems preferable to the latter, especially since we would normally expect taswib as-sakm to mean ‘directing the arrow straight at the mark’, a sense which it clearly cannot have in the


ON FAULTS & INJURIES TO WHICH ARCHERS ARE EXPOSED 121

777 context. But what sounds are emitted by an arrow? There is only one sound, and that is produced when the shaftment strikes the arrow-pass as it leaves the bow, the cause being either the use of unsuitable or defective equipment, or an error on the part of the archer. More precisely, it is caused by ‘twisting the grip on loosing, a bad grasp, pinching the nock’ or by ‘too big a loop, or a bad arrow that is defective either because it is too thin or of too weak a wood or roughly cut in the making’ (C!, 66a-b; C?, 1o6a-b; C*, 555—562, ctc.). Practical trials so far completed suggest that the archer’s errors said by our author to result in raswib as-sahm do not result in the emission of any sound, but rather in low flight. We therefore retain tagwib and take the expression to mean ‘causing the arrow to fly low" (from lack of initial velocity) on the basis of the senses ‘to lower’, as of the head, and ‘to descend’ indicated for forms II and V respectively of the Arabic root from which tagzi derives.


6. ‘Predominance’ of the Lower Limb

778 ‘Predominance of the leg of the bow’ (p. 118) is the best translation we can offer of the words qiyàm rij! al-qaws. It is a difficult expression with which Faris and Elmer had also to come to grips (Arab Archery, p. 72, n. 29). The sense, on the other hand, seems to be fairly clear. The implication is that the lower limb of the bow 3s the stronger. Under these circumstances the lower limb travels faster than rhe upper when the bow is loosed, and at the instant the arrow leaves the string the nock is too low in relation to the thumb of the bow-hand, thereby causing the shaft—propelled by uneven thrust—to rub too much against the thumb. A composite bow can develop such a fault even though both limbs were correctly balanced at the time of manu- facture. It can be easily corrected by heat treatment (above, p. 99), as we have proved by


experiment.
