# 3 - On Bows

Although there are many kinds of bow, there are basically only two: the hand bow (*gaws yad*) and the crossbow (*qaws rijl*).

There are many kinds of hand bow. There is the old [Beduin] Arab bow, which they used to make of *nab'* (*Grewia poplifolia*) and also of *shawhat*, which is the same as *murrãn* (*Cornus mas*).  This bow was made either of one stave or two [jointed together]. The ancient Arab poet says:

> I shoot with this which is all one branch and is three cubits and a finger.

The settled Arabs, on the other hand, applied sinew to the backs of their bows (*yu'agqibūna zẓhūrahā*) and often lined the bellies with goat horn. Peculiar to the noble Hejaz, these kinds of bow have neither *siyahs* nor [shaped] handles (*magābid*).

There is also the intermediate bow (*wāsiṭiyyah*), which is made of horn, wood, sinew, and glue.  It was so called because it occupies an intermediate position between the Hejazi bow and tbe Persian bow. The Arabs also call it *munfaṣilah* (‘that comprising separate elements [fitted together]’)

The Khorasanians adhere to the principle that [the length of] the lower siyah should be one sixth of the laminated portion of the bow, the upper siyah being longer by as much as the measurement of the little finger when turned down in finger-reckoning (on which, see Appendix 4). The working part of the upper limb would, in this case, be as long as the archer’s forearm, and the lower as long as his upper arm.

The Turks, Persians, and Iraqis are for their part agreed on the principle that the longer the siyahs and the shorter the limbs and the more rigid and slender the handle, the better the cast (*aṭrad li-s-sahm*). Better cast is in particular achieved by the slender bow (i.e. the flight bow; Ch. 19), in which, by their rule, the limbs must fall back (*mustalqi*; see Glossary) and the grip be short.

The best and most useful hand bows are those composed of wood, sinew, horn, and glue. Its composite character displays profound wisdom and august and sublime workmanship, for it is produced after the formation of a human being and is of comparable structure. For even as man is built on four foundations, namely, bone, flesh, arteries, and blood, so is the [composite] bow formed in like manner inasmuch as the wood corresponds to bone in man, the horn to flesh, the sinews, which are intricately disposed throughout its members, to the arteries, which are intricately disposed throughout man's members, and the glue to the blood by which the whole is held together. Like man, bows are provided with a back and a belly and can bend bellywise like man. When they are bent backwards, they will snap, as would be the case with man.

Authorities on archery agree that in our time the best bows of this type are those manufactured in Syria, the finest of them being the excellent weapon known as the ‘superb’ (*fahlah*), which is the handiwork of the most highly esteemed masters (*ustādin*) of the bowyer’s art. This is because they have power, strength, speed of recovery (*as-sur'ah fi d-dawarān*) suppleness, liveliness, and efficiency of performance.  Furthermore, they have beauty and grace, give a smooth and comfortable draw (*salas al-jadhb wa-ḥalāwatuhu*), and are light and elegant to carry.  They shoot further and launch more effective shafts (*ankā sihām*) than any other kind of hand bow.  These are facts which could be denied by no one but a person unacquainted with a bow of this type or someone who had failed to get a really good specimen. If he has one, the archer should look after it well and keep it under constant supervision.

The proficient artisan is a man of experience with a mastery of the essentials of his craft.  Moreover, in all things capability is *the* essential. This is particularly true of the bowyer's art, for the fashioning of a bow calls for more competence than anything else if a truly good weapon is to be obtained. Its manufacture also calls for more patience, since it cannot be properly completed in less than a full year. Autumn must be devoted to the carving and preparation of the wooden core (*al-khashab*), on the one hand, and to the sawing and fitting of the horn (*al-lihām*), on the other. Winter is the season for binding and reflexing (*al-hasm wa-r-raf*), and then at the beginning of spring the sinew is applied (*tarkib al-'aqab*). Next, in summer, the bow, as yet unfinished (*khām*), is strung and rounded to the curvature required (*layyuhā halgat*). It is then veneered with bark and painted (*at-tatwiz wa-d-dihān*).

According to the consensus of masters with experience of the weapon, be they craftsmen or archers, the mean length of a bow of this type, taken from nock to nock, should amount in all to one cubit and two-thirds and one-quarter of a cubit (50.2 in.), the unit of length being the carpenter’s cubit, that is to say, the Hāshimi cubit, which admits of no variation, but is of uniform length in all Muslim countries.

Analysis of the length of the bow should be in the following measurements: the upper *dustār* (*d. al-yad*) should be one-half and one-eighth of a cubit (16.36 in.) and the lower *dustār* (*d. ar-rijl*) one-third and one-quarter of a cubit and one-half of a *qirāt* (15.82 in.); the grip should be one-eighth and one-half of one-eighth of a cubit (4.91 in.) and be broad, not rounded (i.e. presumably, in transverse section either ovate or elliptical from belly to back), so that it may not turn in the hand, and, further, [to provide a finger hold], be scooped at the sides; the length of the upper *siyah* should be one-quarter of a cubit (6.55 in.), the lower *siyah* measuring one-quarter of a *qtrāt* less (0-28 in.). They say that, like a growing branch, the thickest part of the limb should be that adjoining the grip. It should then taper until its most slender portion is formed by the tip of the siyah. The upper limb should be a little fuller than the lower and, unlike the latter, not be weakened by curtailment (for, the limbs being of unequal length, the lower must be a little weaker, if both are to flex equally when drawn). The length of the bow described is intended for really average men and truly medium heights as they are in our time.  Some people, however, have shorter *siyahs* and longer working limbs. In such cases the recognized length of the upper *siyah* is one-sixth of a cubit and one and one-quarter *qirāt* (5.72 in.), the lower siyah being five *qirāts* exactly (5.45 in.). The upper *dustār* will measure one-half and one-eighth of a cubit and one-quarter of one-eighth of a *qirāt* (16-4 in.), amounting to one-third of the bow. The lower dustár will measure one-third and one-quarter of a cubit and one-half and one-quarter and one-eighth of a *qirāt* (16.23 in.). "The grip will measure one-eighth and one-half of one-eighth of a cubit (4.91 in.).

Flight bows (*qisiyy as-sabq*) should have short limbs, long necks, and speed of recovery (*[sur'at] at-tarjih*). The way to string bows of this type is first to straighten out the curvature of tbe neck and *dustār* on each side (i.e. by retracting the *siyahs* from the reflexed position) and then to flex [simultaneously] and to the same degree the centre of each limb. For every ten *ratls* 40.7 lb.) of bow weight there should be one *dirkam’s* weight (47.6 gr.) of silk for the string, such material being raw, wound silk that is new and extremely strong. Such is the information that we have on the subject,

Crossbows are of different types. The Franks, for instance, have the *jarkh*, the Maghrebis (North Africans) the *laqshah*, the Persians and Turks the *zanbūrak* and Islam (the Mamelukes?) the *bandūg*. Crossbows of this type (*or* ‘the last-mentioned type’; the text is not clear) are the most useful for land-forces. For naval operations, on the other hand, the most useful type is that made of yew (*tags*). The limb of this weapon should be made of two opposing staves (i.e. presumably, one of two halves of a split length is reversed and joined to the other), and its stock should be of boxwood or orange.


In the West (i.e. North Africa and Muslim Spain) crossbows are a great favourite and are the weapons of preference. Those who use hand bows, however, deprecate them. My own view is that in the manoeuvres of [mounted] combat, in the desert, and on expeditions the hand bow is a better and more serviceable weapon, whereas in fortresses, sieges, and ships greater power and advantage will be derived from the crossbow.

The first thing that an archer must look at in his bow is the grip (*al-gabdah*). The main point about this is that it should be just right for the hand and be neither too big nor too small for it.  To examine the grip, he should grasp it with the whole hand and all fingers after first pushing back the flesh of his palm away from the base of his fingers into the centre of the hand. He should then look to see whether the tips of his fingers touch the heel of the hand. If they do, then the grip of the bow js too thin for the hand. If, however, there is half a finger's width or less to spare between the far border of the finger-tips and the heel of the hand, the size is just right. A greater or lesser gap is unsuitable, for if the grip is too thin for the hand, the tips of the fingers will touch its heel, in which case the grip will turn in the archer's hand at the draw, and he will not shoot well.

If it so happens that the archer can only get a bow that is too thin in the handle for his needs, he should build up the grip by affixing leather tailored to the size of his grasp so that the - grip will then fit the hand. In extremes of temperature and for sweaty hands a piece of leather on the grip is particularly useful.

So far as the power of the bow is concerned, authorities on archery are agreed that the skill of the archer entirely depends upon his using a bow that is within the limits of his own strength and physical power. In time past archers have only been concerned with those points on which they differed and prided themselves, namely, technique and grouping (*jam*'), without anyone ever mentioning so much as a word about the strength of the bow. Nevertheless, it is said that one should not shoot with a bow unless it is less powerful than himself and that no one ever shot with a bow that was even a fraction too strong for him without its revealing his faults and incapacity, doing him harm, ruining his shooting, and emboldening his rival without his knowing it.
