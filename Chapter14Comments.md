fact follow through, otherwise consistent and accurate performance is unattainable. At full draw a pressure of perhaps 60 Ib. or more is exerted by the bow-hand and arm against the grip of the bow. When the string is loosed, some movement must result from muscular reaction following the sudden removal of pressure. In a correctly executed shot the bow-hand should move directly towards the target. This forward movement is slight, but somewhat more complex than our simplified explanation is apt to suggest (for a more detailed exposition of the subject, see Archery : the Technical Side, pp. 141-46). In order to assure the movement, many modern archers con- sciously thrust the bow-hand towards the target and, keeping the hand at the end of the act in the same plane as before it, hold the position for a second or two. This action constitutes the basic follow-through, of which the main characteristic is that the hand remains in line with the target until the arrow is well clear of the bow. Experience shows that if an archer develops the habit of dropping his bow-arm as soon as he has made his shot, he is liable to start letting it fall before the arrow has in fact left the string. If he shoots in this way, the least that can happen to his arrow is that it will fly low. i

520A brief reference has already been made to the forward movement of the bow-hand (above, P- 41). Its importance was recognized by the authors of Arabic manuals, but the fact is apt to escape the attention of the layman since the subject is not treated under a separate head as in the present case. Generally speaking, it is discussed in conjunction with the movement of the drawing hand away from the target as an integral part of the accomplishment of the loose. What they have to say on the matter is largely suggestive of modern teaching: the hands are to move away from each other (sc. in line with the target), the chest to be widely expanded, and the shoulder-blades drawn together. In Arab Archery (pp. 60-61) there would seem to be no doubt that the author is speaking of a follow-through along these lines, though this is not immediately apparent from the English translation, in which, to judge from parallel texts (e.g. Tabsirah, 74a-b; Wadih, 242), the technical sense of the key verb would seem to have eluded the trans- lator, The verb to which we refer is that interpreted as ‘release’ in cases such as ‘releasing both hands simultaneously’, ‘beware of releasing one hand before the other’, ‘releasing the one and leaving the other unreleased’, etc. If we are not mistaken, the verb in fact is used in reference to positive movement of the bow-hand towards the target and of the drawing hand away from it.

The form of follow-through with the bow-hand advocated by Taybughà is the &Aarrak, a term which, in the absence of a suitably simple English equivalent, is more easily explained than translated. As in the case of the kind of follow-through with which the modern target archer is familiar, the bow-arm remains in line with the target and the hand is punched towards the mark. By contrast, however, the wrist is bent and the hand dipped to rotate the upper end of the bow directly forward. po

521From the technical standpoint the kharrah may be criticized on the grounds that tilting of the string js apt to begin before the departure of the arrow. If such a movement is invariable, however, the archer will learn to make allowance for its effects. Furthermore, a positive action does make for consistency and elimination of any variations in the movement of the bow that might otherwise occur: - l -

The raison d'étre of the khatrah would appear to reside in the method of grasping the bow as- advocated in Chapter8 where it is laid down that the little finger should exert the greatest pressure ` on the handie, or grip, the ring-finger less, and the middle finger least. If these instructions are followed, it will be found that the bow's grip is subjected to forward rotary pressure. Reduced to its simplest terms the explanation is not far to seek. Although the main pressure of the grasp falls on the sides of the handle, some pressure is nevertheless communicated to the back of the bow near the base of the handle, while, at the top end of the latter, pressure is taken by the belly at the point where it rests in the fork of the thumb and index finger (Fig. 26). It is evidently Taybugha’s intention to permit the resulting forward rotary pressure to find its logical con~ ` clusion in forward rotary movement rather than to try to counter a natural tendency in this direction

by reversal of muscular action, for to arrest the movement in such a way could lead to erratic shooting. The khaprah, then, may be considered a logical development within the framework - of his whole method of shooting, and, as such, must be commended.

523In MSS of the B and C groups the suggestion that the bow may be controlled by the string’s lightly catching the forearm is replaced by the recommendation that the downward movement of the bow be arrested by the siyak's lightly striking the base of the armpit (frontispiece). The first method may well have been idiosyncratic and on that account dropped, though whether by Taybugh4 himself in some revised version or by an editor, it is impossible to say. It is note- worthy, however, that a very similar method is mentioned later in the present work (p. 130).
