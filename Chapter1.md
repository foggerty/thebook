# 1 - Doxology and Ṭaybughā's Introduction

## Dogology

> In the name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate. > My Lord, ease my task for me, O Thou who art-bountiful.

Praise be to God, whose judgement is just, whose knowledge is complete, whose dominion is almighty, whose proof shines forth with overwhelming light;

Who protects and safeguards His friends, who plucks out and shatters His foes;

Who grants victory and succour to the Faith (i.e. Islam), who subdues and scatters Unbelief;

Who unleashes His might and affliction [against those who reject His authority, who brings in] all His servants beneath His sovereign power!

Without recourse to any, He does what He wishes; whatever He wills comes to pass without hindrance; whatever He decrees is executed unchallenged.

It is He who has made men in their several kinds: the guided, the straying, the happy, the wretched, the clever, the stupid.

It is He who pays each group of humankind its due, be it vengeance or punishment, favour or rewards, neither diverting men from that which they earn for themselves nor turning them away from that which they deserve.

To Him be praise for that He has rendered the company of His supporters victorious and subdued His enemies — praise with which the banners of Islam will rise supreme and mastery will, in the course of time and with the passing of the days, be gained over all places and all mankind!

The blessing and peace of God be upon our lord Muhammad, the Chosen, Bearer of the Un-chailengeably Truthful Message and Incisively Manifest Discourse, Head of the Pious House and Unsullied Line, whom God sent as Prophet and Messenger that he might be a pathway to His knowledge and a pilot to the paths of His guidance, so that at the last he caused Truth to prevail and be followed, and falsehood to be vanquished and repulsed — a blessing to include his godly Family and his excellent Companions!

## Introduction

Since archery and riding are enjoined by authentic command of the Prophet himself and as I knew of no treatise by any previous author on the subject of shooting from horseback, I felt I should like to accord the excellent accomplishments of archery and riding joint treatment in a single work. My aim is so doing would be to comply with the command of God and His Messenger  and to assist those of my Muslim brethren who campaign and fight in the Holy War. [This I could do] by virtue of such knowledge of the subject as Almighty God had imparted to me over a long period of painstaking care and endeavour and after acquiring familiarity with most of the information on record regarding the primary and secondary bases.of archery as expounded in time past by men of repute and distinction who ranked among the authorities of their day and who lived in, and hailed from, all countries. I therefore wrote the exposition of theory and practice of the art to both infantry and cavalry. When my poem was finished and proved to be a comprehensive basic work on this art and a full, perfect, and useful authority worthy to be placed at their service, I supplemented it wit a commentary and [introduced] a number of principles [not previously enunciated] and [added new] sections to put the finishing touches to the content of the poem and to elucidate difficult points. By so doing, it has been my intention to explain modes of expression and throw light on allusions, so that the rarities of its contents might be brought within the grasp of him who would seck them out. May God, therefore, have mercy upon any man who views my work with approval and makes good any imperfections which it may contain! In order to carry out my task I went into seclusion and, far from my homeland and handicapped by an inability to express myself well because of my barbarous Arabic, produced my poem.

## Translator's Comment

Archery is a religious obligation established in the Koran on the basis of Muhammad’s own explanation of sura viii. 62, where the word *quwwah* (‘force’) is taken to refer to archery.  The Prophet himself, furthermore, was an archer and possessed three bows. The terms in which he urged his community to practise riding and archery - preferably the latter - amount to a standing order, and archery is a *fard kifāyah* (i.e. a religious obligation incumbent, not upon each individual, but upon the community by representation). When his Companions engaged in archery contests, the Prophet used to attend and would support one or other of the contending parties.

Certain authors relate that Adam, after being sent down from paradise, was commanded to raise crops. Two birds ate what he sowed, and so he complained to God, who sent Gabriel with a bow, a string, and two arrows. Being asked what these things were, Gabriel explained, as he handed them over, that the bow was the force (*quwwah*) of God, the string was the might (*shiddah*) of God, and the arrows the harm to be inflicted (*nikāyah*) by God. He then taught Adam to shoot, whereupon he killed the birds. Knowledge of archery then passed to Abraham, Ishmael and Isaac, and archery is indeed the legacy of these illustrious ancestors.

There is an authentic tradition of the Prophet that it is a sin to give up archery after learning the art. There are, furthermore, numerous traditions of the Prophet which commend archery.  He himself used to preach, leaning on a bow, and considered that there was no better weapon.  Gabriel had an Arab bow on the day of the battle of Uhud (fought between Muhammad and the tribe of Quraysh to the north of Medina, March, A.D. 625). The excellence of the bow is the subject of many traditions of the Prophet, which are too numerous for inclusion in the present work (sb-9b).
