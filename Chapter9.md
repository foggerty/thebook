# 9 - On nocking

One way of taking up the arrow prior to nocking, which is the second fundamental, is to take hold of it - [nock towards the elbow] - with the palm and [all five] fingers of the right hand as if you were taking hold of a stave. This is a Turkish method of taking up an arrow (*maskah Turkiyyah*). An accomplished archer will take hold of the shaft with the middle finger, thumb, and index finger, and have the arrowhead in front of the ends of his fingers. The arrow in this case is held at a point two-thirds [of the distance from the head], the remaining third coming up towards the forearm through the centre of the groove formed between the right index finger and thumb. [The effect will be that of a scribe taking hold of a pen.]

Of these two methods, the first is more convenient, reliable, and practical for the archer, especially if the arrow is to be drawn from a quiver. Hold the arrow in position with the fingers of your left hand. In other words, hold the shaft with the left thumb, index finger, and middle finger against the grip of the bow. Some people call this the ‘clinging lock’ (*‘aqd al-luzūm*) of the left hand on the arrow.

Take the nock of the arrow in the three appropriate fingers - the thumb, index finger, and middle finger of the right hand - and, while nocking, keep your eyes on your foe. Now nocking is the operation of fitting the arrow’s notch to the string, this notch being termed the *fūg* of the arrow or the *kāz*, which is a Turkish word (i.e. *gez*}. The operation should be carried out in the following manner. [Once the arrow is held in place against the grip], you should run your fingers over the stele (*badan as-sahm*) to see whether there is any break or fault in your shaft [such as splits or splinters which may injure the left thumb]. You continue to run your fingers along it in this way until the nock of the arrow finds its way into the centre of the middle phalanges of the middle finger and index finger and the proximal margin of the distal phalanx of the thumb, Then, [with fingers pressing on the nock], you give [the end of the shaft] one shove with the right hand and bring back the left [which is holding the bow] without allowing the string [against which the arrow is running] to leave the stele until the string [comes in under the thumb and] rides just clear of the nock. You then move both hands back (i.e. in the direction from which they came) and slip the string into the nock, still keeping your eyes on your foe. In other words, at no time do you look at the nocking operation, but rather keep your eyes fixed all the while on the mark at which you are about to shoot, that is to say, the: enemy's position. [It cannot be overemphasized that] your sight must be trained constantly upon this mark without leaving it even for a single instant, for if an archer takes his attention away from his foe, the latter will do him some injury and perhaps even kill him. All archers must put in a good deal of practice until their eyes get accustomed to being used in this way and the operation becomes a natural function.

The business of nocking that has just been described should be executed with rapidity, which can only be acquired by repeating the operation time after time. Only constant practice will bring the experience required by the technique, for to nock speedily without looking at the operation is difficult and can only be achieved by repeated practice and constant training.

## Translators' Comment

Nocking is treated, to a greater or lesser extent, by different authors in different ways. Here is not the place to assemble all the material we have discovered on the subject and to enter into a comparative study. One or two points, however, do call for some comment, and for this purpose *Arab Archery* may be used to most advantage, It should be noted that, in order to avoid vexatious repetition of references, it is to pp. 40-42 of this work that we refer,


### Taking Hold of the Arrow

**The ‘Turkish’ method**
This is identical with that said in Arab Archery to have been advocated by the school of Tāhir al-Balkhi.  It was ‘easier than other methods and a speedier way of drawing an arrow from the quiver when in hot pursuit of game or an adversary’.  Hence its appeal to Taybughā, the exponent of military techniques.

**The ‘pen’ method**
This is identical with that said in *Arab Archery* to have been advocated by the school of Abii Hashim. Taybughā omits to indicate that the little finger and ring-finger were folded into the palm.

There is no mention in our treatise of the method said in *Arab Archery* to have been preferred by the school of Ishāq. This consisted in picking up the arrow with the index finger and the middle finger at one span’s distance away from the arrowhead just as a bird would pick up a piece of straw in its beak. It is ignored by our author presumably because it had no place in combat.

### Supporting the Arrow at the Grip

On this point the author of *Arab Archery* is more informative than Taybughā and offers two basic methods. The archer could either (a) place the arrow at one fist’s distance from its head between the left thumb, index finger, and middle finger which had already been released from the grip for that purpose, or (b) keep the said three fingers closed on the grip until the right and left hands came together, at which moment he would open them (ie. the left fingers) and put a lock on the arrow at one span from the head while running his right hand over the remainder of the stele as far as the nock to detect any faults there might be in his shaft. This second method is said to have been that of Tāhir’s school. From careful reading of the text it would seem to have differed from the first only in two points, viz. the manner in which the fingers took the arrow, and the distance at which the stele was held from the head.

===In MSS of the C group mention is made only of the left index finger and thumb in this connexion (C1, 40a; C4, 66a; C}, 32b).===


### The Position of the Nock against the Fingers

According to *Arab Archery*, the nock prior to insertion of the string into the notch should rest against the fingers in one of three positions, which differ fractionally from those given by Taybughā. They are, however, worth mentioning if only to illustrate the wide divergence of opinion on the subject. After running his hand down the stele the archer could hold the nock (a) between the index finger and the thumb with the notch against the distal phalanx of the middle finger (Abū Hāshim), or (b) with the middle phalanx of the index finger, the fore part of the thumb, and the tip of the middle finger (Tāhir), or (c) between the index finger and thumb with the notch between the first two phalanges of the middle finger (Ishāq).

### Insertion of the String

Two basic methods are advocated in Arab Archery, When the stele is against the string the archer may (a) quickly and forcefully push the arrow forward and bring the nock back on to the string (Abū Hāshim), or (b) push forward without clearing the string and then open the fingers to nock as soon as string and nock make contact (Tāhir, Ishāq).

### The Nocking-point

This is the part of the bowstring to which the nock of the arrow is set. Since it tends to be taken for granted by many Islamic authors it is worth while to note the following remarks

> The nocking-point (*mawdi at-tafwīq*) on the string should be directly in line with the arrow-pass (*majrā s-sahm min qabdat al-qaws*), being a little higher if the mark is at close range and a little lower for shooting at long range. If one nocks low, the arrow will fly beyond the target, which is a desirable thing in flight shooting or when shooting at a man in armour. so that the arrow may fly upwards and slip in between the laminae . . .

All existing silk bowstrings from the Middle East that have been so far examined are bound with thread at the centre to prevent chafe on the string from the thumb and the nock of the arrow. In an old string the nocking-point is also a common breaking-point, hence the need for added protection there. In some cases extra binding is found immediately above the nocking- point, and the extra thickness provides a means of accurately locating the nock. The arrow can then be nocked just below the binding and slipped up the string until it is stopped by this thickened portion. This ensures that the arrow is nocked at the same place each time, As none of the strings examined go back more than about two centuries and since we have found no earlier evidence of any kind to indicate that the nocking-point was in any way marked, it may well be that this practice was a later innovation.

To nock quickly without looking is a very difficult operation. Nevertheless, we have no reason to doubt that proficiency could be achieved after many hours of practice.
