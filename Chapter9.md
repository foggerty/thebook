# 9 - On Nocking (*tafwiq*)

One way of taking up the arrow prior to nocking, which is the second fundamental, is to take hold of it - [nock towards the elbow] - with the palm and [all five] fingers of the right hand as if you were taking hold of a stave. This is a Turkish method of taking up an arrow (*maskah Turkiyyah*). An accomplished archer will take hold of the shaft with the middle finger, thumb, and index finger, and have the arrowhead in front of the ends of his fingers. The arrow in this case is held at a point two-thirds [of the distance from the head], the remaining third coming up towards the forearm through the centre of the groove formed between the right index finger and thumb. [The effect will be that of a scribe taking hold of a pen.]

Of these two methods, the first is more convenient, reliable, and practical for the archer, especially if the arrow is to be drawn from a quiver. Hold the arrow in position with the fingers of your left hand. In other words, hold the shaft with the left thumb, index finger, and middle finger against the grip of the bow. Some people call this the ‘clinging lock’ (*‘aqd al-luzūm*) of the left hand on the arrow.

Take the nock of the arrow in the three appropriate fingers - the thumb, index finger, and middle finger of the right hand - and, while nocking, keep your eyes on your foe. Now nocking is the operation of fitting the arrow’s notch to the string, this notch being termed the *fūg* of the arrow or the *kāz*, which is a Turkish word (i.e. *gez*}. The operation should be carried out in the following manner. [Once the arrow is held in place against the grip], you should run your fingers over the stele (*badan as-sahm*) to see whether there is any break or fault in your shaft [such as splits or splinters which may injure the left thumb]. You continue to run your fingers along it in this way until the nock of the arrow finds its way into the centre of the middle phalanges of the middle finger and index finger and the proximal margin of the distal phalanx of the thumb, Then, [with fingers pressing on the nock], you give [the end of the shaft] one shove with the right hand and bring back the left [which is holding the bow] without allowing the string [against which the arrow is running] to leave the stele until the string [comes in under the thumb and] rides just clear of the nock. You then move both hands back (i.e. in the direction from which they came) and slip the string into the nock, still keeping your eyes on your foe. In other words, at no time do you look at the nocking operation, but rather keep your eyes fixed all the while on the mark at which you are about to shoot, that is to say, the: enemy's position. [It cannot be overemphasized that] your sight must be trained constantly upon this mark without leaving it even for a single instant, for if an archer takes his attention away from his foe, the latter will do him some injury and perhaps even kill him. All archers must put in a good deal of practice until their eyes get accustomed to being used in this way and the operation becomes a natural function.

The business of nocking that has just been described should be executed with rapidity, which can only be acquired by repeating the operation time after time. Only constant practice will bring the experience required by the technique, for to nock speedily without looking at the operation is difficult and can only be achieved by repeated practice and constant training.
