# 26 - On shooting with an arrow guide

There are many kinds of arrow-guide. Although originally designed for older men who were past drawing strong bows and shooting long arrows, guides (*majāri*) have truly considerable advantages. In the first place they enable anyone using darts (*nabl*) to carry with him a greater number of missiles - twice as many indeed - than he would be capable of carrying if he were using ordinary long arrows. Another advantage they have is that an enemy, if attacked with darts, will not see them and dodge in the same way as he might if long arrows are used. Yet another advantage is that darts strike home more quickly than long arrows, for they have a longer range. Finally, the enemy cannot make use of darts or shoot them back as he may well do to great effect if long arrows are used,

Among the different types of guide there arc the ‘dart’ (*nabl*), the ‘pen’ (*qalam*), the ‘commander’s’ (*asbāsalāri*), the ‘locust’ (*jarād*), and the ‘Bayram Shah’. The safest and most convenient from the archer's point of view is that called the ‘king-guide’ (*shāh majrā*). This is the one that [is slotted down the middle and] covers both darts and bowstring, for which reason it is called the ‘sultan of arrow-guides’. It is used in the following manner. You first pass the bowstring right through the guide and brace the bow, which now supports the guide. After putting the guide to the nocking-point in the same way as you would nock long arrows set in the centre of the bow (*kabid al-qaws*), you slip your dart through the slot (*shaqq*) right into the guide. The tassel at the end of the guide goes between the ring-finger and middle finger, You now lock on the guide as you would if using long arrows. You also draw and loose in the same way, except that the left arm is held firm like a stock. Nor do you follow through with 4 forward and downward thrust of the bow-hand as you would if shooting long arrows; you execute only half the movement. This is a point to watch. You should also guard against bringing the guide to fuil draw and cocking the thumb in front of your darts. Past masters in the art of shooting with guides can, and do, follow through with a forward and downward thrust of the bow-hand, and they also rest the guide on the left forearm, This is an excellent and more effective way of shooting, but the trouble is that it can do harm to a person who does not know how to apply it properly; for, should the guide slip, it may injure the fingers of his bow-hand (*qubbād*) and put him out of action.

Next there is the 'long-nosed arrow-guide' (*mijrāt al-khurtūm*), This is made of a single length of wood hollowed out (*nunahhr*) on one side into a groove big enough to accommodate darts, At one end of it there is a projection (*khurtūm*, ‘proboscis’) of horn designed to hold the darts in place. To shoot with it, you first insert the bowstring between the horn and the wood of the guide, take the dart, and fit its nock to the string. To nock the dart in the guide, you close the little finger, ring-finger, and part of the middle finger, and then grip the dart [between the thumb] and middle finger and the end of the right index finger which is left open. The head of the dart should be near the end of the right index finger with the long horn nose pressing on the guide. You then nock and shoot in the manner already described.

Archers also use an arrow-guide called the ‘stirrup’ (*mjrat ar-rikāb*) which has a hand-grip of iron and a nut like that of a *jarkh*. It is also known as the 'Maghrebi' because it was invented in the Maghreb (i.e. N.W. Africa). Aithough an excellent device, it is difficult to master, is liable to go wrong, and is heavy. It is nevertheless possible for an archer to develop the strength of his grasp without undue strain on his muscles, so that he can use a guide of this kind with any bow hc can pull, even though it were 100 *ratls*. [For such a person] it has proved one of the best and most effective field weapons, [and if once he can handle it], the archer will find it not only easier to use but also immeasurably more effective than all other kinds of guide. It is difficult to make, but I have developed a modified form and made it the ‘king-guide’ (*shāh mxjrāt*), of which name it is more worthy than the original guide of that name because it allows more rapid shooting than its predecessor, gives greater striking power, permits the use of a more powerful bow, and is an easier and less troublesome weapon for the user. If an archer knows how to handle it properly, he will, by the mere fact of using the weapon, outstrip any archer shooting long arrows both in number of shots and in respect of distance, I have in fact shot six darts with the aid of this device, as against five long arrows shot by an archer in the usual manner. My aim in designing it was to enable the user to shoot *jarkh* bolts back at the enemy and do twice as much damage as the *jarkh*, even though the *jarkh* might be two *qintārs* Damascus weight (about 814 lb.). Failure to achieve this purpose is indicative of bad shooting, incompetence, and witlessness.

To use the guide, the archer first grasps the handle with the index finger, middle finger and ring-finger, and, if the handle is big enough to take it, the little finger as well. He next presses the trigger (*miftāh*, ‘key’) with his thumb, and with the head of the bolts opens the nut (*jawzah*) that is fitted in the guide for catching the string so as to allow the latter to enter its holder (*bayt*).  He then sets the guide in the nocking position so that he can see the string correctly housed, locked, and held by the nut. Then, taking his thumb off the trigger, he proceeds to draw, baving first nocked the bolt in the manner previously described. Once at full draw, he presses the trigger strongly with the thumb and looses, but in so doing does not follow through with any forward and downward movement of the bow-hand. Before letting go of the guide he sets it once more to the nocking-point of his bowstring, takes another bolt, and nocks it, He may shoot in this way as much as he wishes, but the resetting of the string in the nut should follow quickly upon discharge, When he has finished shooting, the archer presses the trigger with his thumb and returns the nut to the same position as before shooting. Great care should be taken not to forget, otherwise the guide will be put out of action and rendered unserviceable. Once this happens it will only work again after being unscrewed and repaired - a difficult task for anyone not familiar with the procedure,

If you have mastered the art of following through with a forward and downward movement of the bow hand, you may use the technique, but do be on your guard, when shooting with guides, against raising the end of your thumb after completing the draw. The same rule applies when shooting with long arrows. Finally, don’t twist the guide when drawing. It should be as straight as a die at the source of traction right from the moment you start to puli until the very moment you loose.
