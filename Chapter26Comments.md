Basically, the arrow-guide is a simple piece of equipment designed to cnable the archer to draw an arrow inside the bow and therefore shoot arrows or darts that would otherwise be too short

for his draw. Faris and Elmer, who were the first in modern times to discuss the nature of this interesting device, rightly consider it to be ‘one of the most important discoveries in modern toxophilitic research’ (Arab Archery, p. 174).

941There is more than one explanation of its origin. The author of Arab Archery—aftet at- Tabari—favours the view that it was invented by ‘the Moslems’ when driven, while fighting ‘the Turks’, to devise some method of suppressing the enemy’s devastating practice of returni spent arrows (p. 124). Others ascribe its invention to the Persians who, after adopting the technique of shooting from the oblique and more effective position in order to overcome the strength of Turkish shields, were obliged to use longer arrows and therefore ‘for the use of old men and youngsters . . . unable to effect the long and hard draws resulting from the very long arrows, evolved shooting with the Ausbän and dawdan arrows; thereby bringing up the driving force of their shots to a par with the shots of the Strong men who could draw a long arrow to the

945 full limit’ (ibid., pp. 124-25). These and other views which need not be considered here recur in technical literature.

Darts for use with arrow-guides varied in length according to type (above, p. 29), and for some we can offer approximate lengths, These are (a) husbán: about 15 in.; (b) dawdan (?, or dudani): about r0 in. ; (c) jarad: from 74 in. to 24 in. ; (d) 'usfüri: as in the preceding (though not according to Arab Archery, p. 129, in which it does not exceed 3 in}. At first sight one is apt to suppose that even the longest dart must have been much lighter than the normal arrow by reason of its shorter shaft. Taybugha offers no details on this aspect of the problem, but in Arab Archery we read: ‘The kind of wood suitable for these arrows is heavy, hard, and strong. Likewise, the arrowheads should be heavy as light ones are worthless... Such arrows should weigh ten dirhams each [about 480 gr.]... The 'usfüri, on the other hand, should weigh three dirhams [about 145 gr.], perhaps even less, and be of very thick wood" (pp. 129-30). If we compare these weights with those of normal arrows shown on p. 30, the war dart may only have weighed 100 gr. less than a long arrow used with the same bow. The difference in weight, therefore, was probably not as great as one might at first suppose. That it nevertheless existed, on the other hand, is inferable from the statement that ‘darts strike home more quickly than long arrows, for they have a longer range’ (p. 145). An increase in speed and range suggests (a) a higher initial velocity consistent with the performance of the lighter missile if shot from the same bow as one that is heavier, and (b) a slight reduction im surface drag resulting from the shorter shaft of the dart.

946It is difficult to say precisely how much truth there is in the assertion that darts would not be seen and avoided in the same way as ordinary arrows. Admittedly, a smaller missile would be a little less conspicuous, and its higher velocity would allow less time for evasion or deflexion with a shield. The most important advantage, however, would undoubtedly lie in the archer’s ability to carry twice as many darts as ordinary arrows. In long-range combat he would obviously be out of action as soon as he had expended the contents of his quiver, and it might take him a little time to replenish it from the supply-train or gather spent arrows shot by the enemy. The more he could conveniently carry with him, therefore, the better.

The archer using a simple guide could quickly change to normal arrows whenever he wished.  In this connexion it is worth noting that in existing Chinese quivers, for instance, there are often as many as four compartments to accommodate different types of arrow. Although we ourselves have found no mention of any similar practice among archers of the Middle East, we do not discount the possibility of its existence.

947 2. Some Forms of Arrow-guide


We know of no surviving example of a Middle Eastern guide. The Koreans, however, used the same device, and a good Korean specimen is included in the Ingo Simon Collection, Manchester Museum, No. O.7728 (Pl. 17). Made from a length of bamboo about } in. in diameter, it is 281 in. long. Viewed in cross-section, it is slightly more than semicircular, and at the rear end there are, as can be seen in the plate, two holes through which a cord or thong was threaded for retaining in the archer's drawing hand. This article represents the guide in its most simple form.  How it was arranged and held can be seen in Fig. 52. Locking in the usual way on both guide and dart, the archer drew both items together. When the string was loosed, the dart was driven down the guide which remained in the drawn position, held by the cord in the fingers of the right hand.

948According to Arab Archery, there were four kinds of guide: square, round, hexagonal, and octagonal (p. 126). How these compared, or whether they corresponded, with the first five listed by Taybugha, it is impossible to say. That known as the ‘pen’ may have been so called because of its appearance, for we learn from Arab Archery that ‘the end of the guide which is

949 toward the bowstring at the time of shooting should be slightly thinner than the other end and should also be pointed like a pen’ (ibid.). The Shape of the rear end of the Korean guide could be roughly described in the same terms, Some clue to the nature of the jarád, or ‘locust’, may, we suspect, be contained in Mardi’s description of the husban, or ‘hailstone’ (Cahen, BEO, XII, Pp. 132-33). The latter was a tubular device accommodating a horn runner with stud-like projec- tions riding in a slot on one side (Fig. 53). Its missiles whose description agrees with that given elsewhere of ‘locusts’ (like ‘hailstones’, a descriptive term from which the guide in each case takes its name) were the length of the little finger. A number of them could be loaded, one after the other, through a hole near the rear end of the guide, which thus amounted to a breech- loading dart projector, When loosed, the runner ejected the darts, which, once discharged, we are told, scattered ‘like locusts’, Although small, light missiles of this kind can have had little pene- trative power, we can imagine their nuisance value as a means of harassing unprotected horses or men.


3. The ‘King-guide’

950The original form of the ‘king-guide’ as described in our text is reasonably clear (Fig. 49).  It was a tubular piece of equipment slotted on opposite sides. The slot in what would be the upper surface when the guide was in use had to be wide enough to admit a dart. That in the lower surface, on the other hand, needed only to be of sufficient width to permit the bowstring free passage.

Two objections can be seen to this sort of contrivance. Firstly, the string must surely have rubbed against the side of the slot through which it ran, with consequent reduction of efficiency arising from friction, Secondly, the fact that the String was threaded through the guide means that, to shoot long arrows, the bow would need to be unstrung to permit removal of the guide.

951The modified ‘king-guide’ evidently combined the idea of the original with that of the ‘stirrup’ variety (Fig. 51), It appears to have been a slotted tube of the kind indicated above.  Built into the stock of the guide at the rear end was a nut of the same form as that used in cross- bows, but no doubt smaller. A trigger mechanism was incorporated, but we are forced to conclude that its design was faulty because of the trouble that could result if the archer failed to reset the nut after use. We offer no suggestions about the possible ways in which the mechanism might have operated since they would of necessity be so conjectural as to be of no real value.

The stirrup which was incorporated in the modified ‘king-guide’ would have permitted a more

powerful draw than any that could be achieved with the thumb, but the claim that it could do twice as much damage as the farkh must be taken with a grain of salt. That it was effective for shooting jarkk bolts if handled by persons not guilty of ‘bad shooting, incompetence, and witlessness’ is probably nearer the truth.

956 4. An Experimental Guide


In the course of many experiments conducted both by ourselves and others the most effective guide of which we have had experience is one constructed by E. G. Heath whose interest and assistance we gratefully acknowledge. Made from well-seasoned beech, it is 31 in. long and rectangular in cross-section. The internal width of the channel is $ in. and its depth a little less than } in. Practical experience has proved the measurements adequate. The rear end tapers ‘like a pen’, and a cord is fitted 14 in. from the tip. In accordance with one of the methods advocated in Arab Archery (p. 126) the cord is tied to a ring which fits on the ring finger during shooting.

957In using the guide we also followed advice contained in Arab Archery regarding the fletching of the 15-in. darts, viz. ‘There should be two side feathers just outside the groove of the guide at the pen-shaped end, and a “male-feather” (dhakar) in the hollow’ (p. 130). Although, in locking, the male-feather is crushed as a result of pressure against the shaft from the middle phalanx of the index finger of the drawing hand, there are no adverse effects since the vane springs back undamaged as soon as the dart is discharged.
