# 23 - The systems of the great masters of archery

The system of Abū Hashim was as follows. When bracing the bow, he would put the *matn* of the grip in the middle of the left palm and place the *siyah* of the leg of his bow under the toes of his left foot. His right palm he would apply to the neck of the bow along with the bowstring and give one push so that the loop would fall into the nock. He would incline the bow on account of the slope of the neck (i.e. he held the bow at the slant and not vertically, the degree of inclination depending on the slope of the neck).

He used the position of acute obliqueness so as to put the mark directly in line with his left shoulder and sighted with both eyes outside (i.e. to the left of) the bow, for he was tall of stature, long-necked, long in the forearm, and long-fingered. He used the square grasp and, when gripping, would place the *matn* of the bow in the middle creases of the little finger, ring-finger, and middle finger of his Jeft hand and in the distal crease of his index finger, with the *ibranjak* of the bow tucked into a point the width of two fingers away from his wrist-bone.

The nock (fūq) of the arrow he would place in the distal crease of his right index finger and middle finger and support the notch (*kāz*) with the pad of his thumb. He would push the shaft forward with his right hand and bring back his left so that nocking took place at a point between his left nipple and his liver (i.e. in the area of the navel). When locking, he would place the bowstring in the distal crease of his thumb and fasten his thumb on the middle finger. His right index finger would be loosely on the thumb with its tip outside (i.e. to the right of) the bowstring.

He would use the lesser draw (*wāfa’ bidāyah*) and draw the shaft on to the tuft of hair between his lips and chin, keeping all (i.e hands, shoulders, and elbow) in a straight line in the same horizontal plane (*'alā khatt al-isiiqā*). Upon loosing, he would follow through with a forward and downward thrust of his bow hand and complete the movement by striking his shoulder-blade with the siyah of his bow. By doing this an archer can determine the length of the bow ‘in relation to the length of his arm’. With his right hand he would give a full twist (*farkah*) so that his right index finger would come to rest beneath the lobe of the ear.

Tāhir al-Balkhi's system was the reverse of Abū Hāshim’s because he was short [with a short armspan] short fingers, a plump hand, short neck, big beard, and wide chest. He squatted in the frontal position and placed the mark in line with his collar-bone, using the oblique grasp. The *matn* of his bow he set in the proximal crease of his little finger, ring-finger, and middle finger of the left hand and in the middle crease of the index finger, with the *ibranjak* of his bow tucked in to a point one finger's width away from his wrist-bone. When nocking, he would dispose the nock of his arrow in the same manner as that already described above. When locking, he would place the bowstring in the distal crease of the right thumb and, having fastened the tip of the thumb on the middle finger, lay the index finger gently on the thumb with the finger-tip inside the bowstring. He would draw on to his cheek in the *wafā bayād* position and hold his left hand still. He would bring his right thumb into a position beneath the lobe of his ear with his finger outside it (i.e. the lobe), and, had a drop of moisture dripped from the sky, it would not have gone down between the thumb and right index finger. The loose was accomplished without formation of the crescent with thumb and index finger (*tahīl*) or forward and downward thrust as he followed through. The movement would have been incompatible with his position directly facing the mark. Because of the shortness of his neck and the size of his beard, Tāhir sighted with both eyes together inside the bow.

The system of Ishāq ar-Raffā was a compromise between the two methods already described, for he was of medium build and would squat in a position between that of acute obliqueness and the frontal. What he did was to bring the target in line with part of his collar-bone. When grasping, he would place the *matn* of the grip between the proximal and middle creases, right in the centre of the proximal phalanges at the base of the three lower fingers of his left hand, and in the distal crease of his index finger, tucking the *ibranjak* in to a point one and a half fingers away from the wrist-bone. He used to place the bowstring in the distal phalanx of the thumb and mount the right index finger gently on the thumb with its tip on the string itself, so that the line of the string would bisect the tip of the index finger. He would draw on his mouth and come to full draw in the *misāh s-sawād* position (*bayād*; above). He would snatch and with half the full movement follow through [with a forward and downward thrust of the bow-hand] and half twist with the other to bring the finger-nail of the right index finger into position under the lobe of his ear.

Because of his desire to develop a suitable technique, *at-Tabari* [who was trained in all three systems] squatted in the same way as Ishāq, adopted Tāhir’s grasp, braced and sighted after the fashion of Abū Hāshim, used a lock that was a compromise between that of Tāhir and that of Ishāq and drew on the mouth after the manner of Ishāq. At-Tabari is the author of the *Kitāb al-idāh* (for *K. al-wādih*, “The Clear Book’).
