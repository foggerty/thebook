# 16 - On shooting the stirrup crossbow from horseback

To shoot this weapon, the mounted archer should equip himself with a broad strap after the style of the familiar Frankish drawing-strap (*jabbadh*). The drawing-claw (*khattaf*) should have two hooks. What the archer does is to slip the drawing-strap over his left shoulder like a strap of the kind used by porters for heaving massive loads (*hamīlat al-haykal*), placing the claw below his right armpit [close to the nipple When he wishes to shoot, he takes the reins in his left hand and the bow in his right and sets the string in the hooks, keeping the stock right in between them. He then bends forward in a stooping position until the front-half of his right foot is in the stirrup with which his weapon is equipped. The archer now stands in his stirrups, as he draws the string at its centre point until it catches in the stock-nut (*jawzah*) and he can then settle it firmly with his right hands. This done, he bends over [forward, removes his foot from the bow], and, lifting the crossbow off the hook, transfers it to his left hand and holds it along with his reins. He nocks his bolts (*nabl*) with the right hand and shoots in the usual way to destroy the enemy.

Finding that the long, heavy bow that is made for men with a powerful pull of 10 *ratls* Syrian weight was a highly effective weapon in the field, I made a stock for it, such as the stirrup crossbow has, and then for the stock I designed a sturdy nut, which has proved to be one of the best there is. One of its great advantages is that its action is automatic in that, once the string is drawn right up to it, it catches it without the intervention of any manual operation whatsoever. Another of its merits is that the string never leaves the surface of the stock, and one is thus safeguarded against all mishaps likely to befall the user of the usual stirrup crossbow.  The archer does not have to adjust the nut immediately after each shot as he must with the normal weapon of this kind. On the contrary, he doesn’t touch it with his hand at all. I also fitted a long clip (*khurtūm*, literally, ‘proboscis’) of horn over the nut to prevent the bolts from falling out during shooting.

This weapon has proved to be one of the most useful of all arms available to warriors in the service of God and the most effective against the enemy. It is, furthermore, a weapon so simple that even a slightly-built archer can, without any discomfort, shoot a bow with a draw-weight close on one *qintar* (100 *ratls*), Syrian weight, or even more. It is also an easier Weapon for the learner than either the hand bow or the ordinary stirrup crossbow. As a weapon, its strength and effectiveness are facts which common sense cannot refute because it does the work of the normal bow of its type but has greater power. Furthermore, it can be used after only a few days’ practice. It would take too long to elaborate upon its superiority and advantages. Let us then be content with the little that has already been said, which is quite enough for anyone of any wit and common sense.
