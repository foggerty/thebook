# 16 - On shooting the stirrup crossbow from horseback

To shoot this weapon, the mounted archer should equip himself with a broad strap after the style of the familiar Frankish drawing-strap (jabbadh; Fig. 29). The drawing-claw (Ahaitdf) should have two hooks. What the archer does is to slip the drawing-strap over his left shoulder like a strap of the kind used by porters for heaving massive loads (hamilat al-haykal), placing the claw below his right armpit "close to the nipple’.? "When he wishes to shoot, he takes the reins in his left hand and the bow in his right and sets the string in the hooks, keeping the stock right in

between them.!? He then bends forward in a stooping position until the front half of his right foot is in the stirrup with which his weapon is equipped. The archer now stands in his stirrups, as he draws the string at its centre point until it catches in the stock-nut (jawzah) and he can then settle it firmly with his right hands. This done, he bends over ‘forward, removes his foot from the bow,! and, lifting the crossbow off the hook, transfers it to his left hand and holds it along with his reins!.* He nocks his bolts (nabl) with the right hand and shoots in the usual way to destroy the enemy.

598TFinding that the long, heavy bow that is made for men with a powerful pull of roo razis Syrian weight (?; see p. 88) was a highly effective weapon in the field, I made a stock for it, such as the stirrup crossbow has, and then for the stock I designed a sturdy nut, which has proved to be one of the best there is. One of its great advantages is that its action is automatic in that, once the string is drawn right up to it, it catches it without the intervention of any manual operation whatsoever. Another of its merits is that the string never leaves the surface of the stock, and one is thus safeguarded against all mishaps likely to befall the user of the usual stirrup crossbow.  The archer does not have to adjust the nut immediately after each shot as he must with the normal weapon of this kind. On the contrary, he doesn’t touch it with his hand at all. I also fitted a long clip (khurtim, literally, ‘proboscis’) of horn over the nut to prevent the bolts from falling out during shooting. (Cf. Fig. 30.)

This weapon has proved to be one of the most useful of all arms available to warriors in the service of God and the most effective against the enemy. It is, furthermore, a weapon so simple that even a slightly-built archer can, without any discomfort, shoot a bow with a draw-weight close on one gintdr (100 rajls), Syrian weight? (?; see p. 88), or even more. It is also an easier Weapon for the learner than either the hand bow or the ordinary stirrup crossbow.f As a weapon, its strength and effectiveness are facts which common sense cannot refute because it does the Work of the normal bow of its type* but has greater power. Furthermore, it can be used after only a few days’ practice. It would take too long to elaborate upon its superiority and advantages. Let us then be content with the little that has already been said, which is quite enough for anyone of any wit and common sense.

599 COMMENT


The foregoing chapter is problematical. Quite apart from its complete absence from A? and the different positions it occupies in the subject sequence of other MSS (n. 1 to Ch. 16, p. 203), there are several respects in which the text of the corresponding section in these other MSS differs from ours both in form and substance. For the sake of example we now compare that portion of our version which is marked with daggers with the corresponding portion in B!.

600 "T had observed this kind of bow for some time and seen the Arab bows with two nocks in their necks that had been designed for this purpose, noting their devastating effectiveness in the field. The usual types of nut, however, were not as satisfactory as one might wish. I therefore racked my brains and finally God, of His goodness and bounty, inspired me with the idea of a new kind of nut, one of the merits of which is that when the bow is drawn and the string makes contact with the nut, it catches the string automatically without any manual intervention on the part of the archer. There is no need, then, for him to adjust the nut imme- diately after each shot as is usually the case. Another of its merits is that the string will not leave the body of the stock when drawn up to the nut as happens with all other crossbows.  I next fitted a long clip of horn over the nut to prevent the bolts from falling out, thus enabling the archer to shoot in any direction he likes, The nut in question is of the usual kind, the only

This weapon, which is a simple affair, is easier for the beginner to handle than the hand bow, and he can shoot long bolts with it,’


Two points are particularly noteworthy, In the first place, it is only in A! and a that the cross.  bow fitted with a stirrup is termed ark. In all MSS of the B group it is merely termed gaw, ar-ryi, ‘crossbow’, Which term is correct it is difficult to say without exhaustive investigation of the problem. We shall for the present confine ourselves to pointing out that Mardi, writing twe centuries earlier, clearly distinguishes between the Jarkh and gaws ar-rikab, stirrup crossbow (BEO, XII, p. 132).

605The second point, which poses a much greater problem, concerns the weight of the bow under discussion. In none of the B group MSS is there any mention of 100 rag! or, indeed, any weight at all. The omission is technically significant, for it is beyond the physical capacity of an archer to draw a hand bow weighing 407 lb., the avoirdupois equivalent of roo Syrian rat/s of the period in question. Even when modified in the manner described, the weapon would almost certainly have been far too heavy for drawing with anything as simple as the belt-and-claw, though it could have been drawn with relative ease by certain forms of mechanism. Since our author is not given to inaccuracies of the order involved in this instance, we can only conclude either that this

portion of the treatise is not his work or that 100 razis is a figurative expression for ‘the heaviest possible’ (cf. English ‘a ton weight’), the qualification ‘Syrian weight’ being an insertion by another hand. The second of these alternatives is quite feasible if account be taken of (a) the fact that the renowned Tahir al-Balkhi is said to haye assigned to the heaviest bow a weight of 100 ratis (above, p. 30), which by the Khorasanian standard of the twelfth century, would amount to no more than 89 lb., and (b) the fact that in no MS of the B group does the qualification ‘Syrian weight’ occur, While the first possibility can by no means be excluded, we are neverthe- less reluctant to dismiss this whole section as the work of a different author since in A! there is

lugs which were then left at the top of the cylinder (Fig. 4). The trigger engaged in a recess cut into the underside of the nut, and it was usually held in this position by a spring. Details of oe mechanisms may be found in the works of Payne-Gallwey and Giorgetti (see Biblio- graphy). |

607When the sere of the trigger was disengaged from the nut, the pull of the string caused the latter to revolve on its spindle in the forward direction, leaving the tail projecting above the stock.  In the case of modern crossbows or older weapons in good working order the string, when re- drawn, travels along the surface of the stock until it reaches and presses against the tail of the nut.

609 fourteenth century the nut had to be reset by hand before the string was drawn back and hooked behind the two lugs, This meant that for the last few inches of the draw the string had to leave the surface of the stock to be lifted over the nut, which is a slightly more difficult operation than that described above.

It may well be that manual resetting was merely an intelligent safety precaution to ensure that the nut really had engaged with the trigger before it received the load of the drawn bowstring.  To speed the reloading operation a reliable self-cocking mechanism is obviously a great asset, but our author’s meagre description does not indicate how he achieved this or why this feature was absent in the usual types of bow. Perhaps they lacked a spring to enable the trigger to engage in the nut.

610The dangers of the usual weapon referred to in our text might, basically, be two. Firstly, because the nut had to be reset by hand, the direction of traction on the string as it was drawn back had to be altered just as it was coming under maximum tension. This would have made the bow more difficult to control at that moment and, if the stock should slip from the grasp in any way, the results could be most unpleasant. Furthermore, as the string left the stock one of the hooks of the claw could get behind one of the lugs of the nut, which would have made it very difficult, if not impossible, to seat the string correctly before disenpaging the claw. The whole operation would then have had to be restarted. Secondly, if the trigger mechanism wäs unreliable, there would have been the danger of the string's being accidentally released. With the archer off his guard, and his hand in the way, he could suffer severe injury. This eventuality could arise from the lack of a spring to secure the trigger which would, under such circumstances, be a ‘hair’ tigger apt to release the nut at the slightest touch.

Our author's mention of a device fitted over the nut to hold the bolt in place is of interest.  A horn spring for this purpose is not mentioned by Payne-Gallwey until he deals with mechanisms of the sixteenth century (Crossbow, pp. 170-72). The advantage of such a fitting to the horse-archer is obvious. Without it he would have to hold the loaded bolt in position with his thumb on the top of the stock until he was ready to shoot, otherwise the bolt would be liable to fall from the bow at any time.

611Generally speaking, the crossbow is not a good weapon for a horseman as it is both cumber- some and slow in operation as compared with the hand bow. As our author so rightly points out when dealing with bows, they are not well suited to cavalry operations. One is inclined to wonder if ail the contents of this chapter are, in fact, intended to apply to the horse-archer at all, Although we have examined many hundreds of miniature paintings from the Middle East, we have not scen one showing a crossbow carried or used by a horseman.
