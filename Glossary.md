## Arabic

This glossary is principally intended to supply definitions which are valid for our text, and, in the interests of simplicity and economy of space, it is only in exceptional cases that reference is made to any additional or different meaning(s) which a given term may have elsewhere in archery literature.  Attention is drawn to the following points:

(i) For the benefit of non-Arabists the terms are arranged alphabetically, not according to roots.  In a few cases where vowels are uncertain we have had to supply them on the basis of our own judgement,

ii) Because they are of special interest to the archer a small proportion of terms from other sources are incorporated. These are marked with an asterisk (*};

(iii) The language from which a term, if not of Arabic origin, is borrowed or derived is indicated in square brackets ( ]. Details are only given where the etymology will not be obvious to the orientalist or differs from that given elsewhere.

(iv) The term ‘bow’ is to be taken as meaning ‘COMPOSITE bow’ unless there is any indication to the contrary.

(v) Left-handed archers should exercise caution where mention is made of ‘left’ and ‘right’.
