Comparable subject matter is to be found in Arab Archery, pp. 18-19, where shooting is said to rest on four pillars, viz. speed, strength (of oneâ€™s arrows), accuracy and care in self-defence, The second of these is similar to the second point in our list, for the argument is that unless one's arrows are strong and penetrating, the enemy will ward them off with his shield. To the four pillars there correspond four entities. With the exception of the thumb-guard, of which there is No mention, they are identical with those given above.
