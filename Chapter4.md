## On bowstrings

Experience with bowstrings led to the use ofa string (zatr) which is twisted lengthwise (musadda) from new, wound silk of high quality. Our knowledge of this particular type we acquired from masters who came from Persia, and in Persian it is called (cha! For flight shooting it is unrivalled by any other known type. There is also the *Cathayan' string which originated in Cathay and was subsequently widely adopted in other countries, It is also made from raw, wound silk—and glue.?* It is more durable than the first kind, is stronger in the bowcase (i.e.  resistant to abrasion and pressure when the bow is carried strung in its case) and is also more serviceable. All other kinds of string are inferior to these two (below, p. 22).

As regards the weight (wasn, i.e. mass) of the string in relation to the weight (kayi, Le, draw weight) of the bow, experts hold that the most satisfactory rule to observe is that contained in the following verse:

‘As weighed by a balance the string should be one-third of one-tenth of one-tenth of one-tenth of the weight of the bow.’

What you do is to ascertain first the weight of the bow in Damascus ratis and then the relative weight of the string it requires including the two end loops and, possibly, two saysaraks (a saysarah in this context being, most probably, some sort of protection against chafe where the loop fits into the nock of the bow). If you work out this formula, you will find that for every thirty rapis (122 lb.) there are six dirhams Damascus weight (285 gr.) because one-tenth of thirty ratis is three, or, in other words, 1,800 dirhams. One-tenth of that is 10 dirhams, one-tenth of which is eighteen, one-third of which is six. This is the reckoning on which there is a consensus of expert opinion, both ancient and modern. They point out that a fine string increases cast, but that an arrow discharged from such a string will flirt. j In the flight shooter’s string (watr as-sibaq) there should be one dirham's weight (47-6 gr.) of new and extremely strong wound silk for each ten rath (40-7 Ib.) of bow weight. It should then be twisted lengthwiset in the appropriate manner, A heavy string will damage the neck of a bow "e reduce its efficiency (because of the extra weight to be carried forward by the limbs of thc W). : 3 ; To weigh a bow, you should string it and then fasten its grip to a peg in the wall or some similar

293rice. Next, you should nock a full-length arrow (sahm ramām; below, p. 27) on the string and Secure it so that it leaves neither the string nor the grip. You now hang your rajls on the string (presumably, in a container)* and continue to add to them until the arrowhead attains the middle of the grip as in the greater draw (kashf bayád; below, p. 128), or comes back as far as the - archer's reach at full draw (wafa’ ar-rémi). The sum of these razis will be the draw-weight of the bow in question. AT a

Some archers weigh the bow with a pulley. What one does in this case is to fix a pulley to a ‘second? peg set ‘on the same! wall in line with the first, ‘the bow being held perpendicularly by

295 the grip to the first peg!. The archer then fastens a rope to the string ‘at the nocking point!, puts the rope into the pulley, and attaches his raz/s to the end of the rope. It is argued that this method reproduces the manner in which the bow is drawn. The first method, however, is the sounder of the two. Only those who wish to exaggerate the power of the bow and make a show of its ; strength adopt the other method (which is inaccurate because the pulley introduces friction loss, thus enabling the weight of the ratis to be increased beyond the weight of the bow).5 Any person weighing a bow should be quick to remove the raris from it, otherwise he will weaken it, and it may well break (since a good bow at full draw is close to breaking point and will, if so held for any length of time, lose some elasticity). It is said, and rightly so, that a thick string will be more tive at short range, and a thin one at long.  . . For crossbows there should be one zgiyyah (almost 5} 02.) of string to every roo ratis (407 lb.)  Damascus weight.** This means that for every ras] of bow weight there should be one-half of a dirham's weight (23:8 gr.) of string. The lathe (i.e. the bow proper of the crossbow) is one-fifth of the string,* and so the length of the actual bow should be multiplied by five. Four strands should be twisted lengthwise from this, and then from each end one should turn back ‘and knot! the two loops of the string. This, then, is the way to obtain the length of the string of the particular crossbow involved.*

299 " Along string will improve cast and put increased sharpness and speed into the arrow. If it is too long, however, ‘it will slip around the side of the siyah, and! the bow will turn itself inside out (i.c. spring violently back into its relaxed, reflexed position), and the string will lash the archer’s forearm and chest. A short string, on the other hand, will give greater accuracy!? and make for a safer and more stable bow. It does, however, give a slow arrow. A string of medium length is more appropriate than either because it gives "perfectly adequate! speed and good grouping, and is safe for both bow and archer. =a "

If the length of the string is assessed from the length of the bow, the string must be shorter than the bow by one-half of one-sixth. The way to do this is-to ascertain the length of the bow : from nock to nock and then to deduct one-half of one-sixth from the result. What remains will be the length of the string for the bow in question, measured from the centre of the ends of the two

loops once the string has been knotted and stretched to prevent it from lengthening out later, The nock of the bow.is, of course, the place where the loop of the bowstring fits. The way to

301 reflection.)

fOnce the bow is strung,!!* place some suitable object between the string and the centre of the grip and if—by the appropriate cubit of the trade—it is one-third of a cubit and one-third of a girdt long (9*1 in.) (or, ‘one-quarter of a cubit and two-thirds of a girár* (7:5 in.), according to a technically more probable variant!?), then the string is just the right length (below, p. 23).

302If the bow is of medium size, being neither long nor short, the size of the string’s loops should be such that one can insert the middle three fingers, or to be more precise, thc index finger, the middle finger, and the third finger of the right band. In size it should be two girdfs (22 in.)  of the cubit specified above, if the siyah is five girádjs (5-5 in.) of the said cubit. The rule for the loop, then, is that it should take three fingers "or measure (roughly) one-third of !* the length of the siyah. The smaller the loop, the greater the cast. A small loop, however, is not without hazard, for it can break the siyak at the top end (ie. at the tip). Too large a loop, on the oth:r hand, will reduce the cast of the bow and can break the siyah at the bottom end (i.e. at its base where the siyah joins the dustar).


COMMENT r, Materials

303 As already stated in our introduction, the basic requirements of a good bowstring are that it should be light, strong, and without stretch once it has settled to the bow. The strings recom- mended by our author were made of unspun, raw silk whose threads were twisted together to form a string of the required length. Glue was used to bind the strands together, the purpose being not only to prevent entanglement upon removal of the string from the bow, but also to increase the strength of the string. Wax could be used instead, but it is not mentioned in our text.

Although silk is Taybugha’s one and only choice, it is noteworthy that Mardi, writing in the twelfth century, makes no mention of any material other than animal hide—and human skin!— though he advocates a mixture of silk with horse-hair for the string of the siege engine called ziyár (Tabsirah, 83a, 97b-98a. Cf. Cahen, BEO, XII, p. 130). The author of Arab Archery, pp.  94-95, while mentioning silk, does not attach the greatest importance to it, but deals at some length with strings made from camel-hide. ‘To produce a string of this material, a strip of leather was subjected to various processes of stretching, twisting, smoothing, and, finally, coating with gum arabic. (On the use of hides, see also Hein, Zs/., XV, p. 7.) It is possible that in early times Turkish strings were made of horse-hair (Hein, ibid., p. 1. Cf. Klopsteg, p. 54).

304 2. Loops '

Most existing strings for use with Oriental composite bows are made with the end loops quite separate from the main string. The latter is a long skein of thread formed by winding around two pegs set at the required distance apart. The loops are knotted into the ends of the skein, as shown in Fig. 13. The same knot was used in bowstrings throughout the East from China to Turkey.  Though more rarely found, some strings were made longer $o that they could be knotted back upon themselves to form the end loops.

The advantage of this second type was that a string-maker could supply prepared lengths which the user could knot to suit his own bow. This would certainly be the more practical approach for the archer in combat and was, we suggest, that adopted by our author, whose interests in the present treatise are primarily military. The first method would impose the necessity of having the skeins of exactly the right length, which would mean that they would have to be made to order unless the archer was prepared to perform the task himself.

| 3. Bracing Height

308For accurate shooting, the bracing height, or distance between the grip and the string of a braced bow, must be constant. Any alteration will affect discharge velocity, a greater height reducing that velocity and a lower height increasing it. Too low a height, moreover, will give rise to an unstable bow. The bracing height achieved by a bowstring of specified length in relation to a given bow can, therefore, be an important guide to anyone attempting to determine the design of a bow. Some versions of our text give measurements amounting to 9-1 in., while others give the equivalent of 7-3 in. A reconstruction of Taybughà's bow from all other specifications at our disposal suggests that the latter figure is correct. (See p. 170.)
