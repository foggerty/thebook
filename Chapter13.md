# 13 - On the lose (*itlāq*)

The traditional teaching of authorities on shooting is that there are two forms of loose whereby the arrow, after being brought to full draw, may be discharged from the centre of the bow (*kabid al-qaws*). One of these is called *mukhtalas* or ‘snatched’. The term is derived from the verb *ikhtalasa*, which is used to describe the action of a thief practising fraudulent sleight-of-hand [and is an appropriate extension of the meaning], for the movement in this kind of loose is such as to be almost imperceptible. The second form is termed the *sākin* ('held'; lit, 'motionless'), the implication being that the completed draw (*al-madd at-tamām*) is followed by a hold (lit. 'steady pause'). There are said to be [not merely two forms of loose, but] three: the snatched, the held, and the twisted (*mafrūk*).

The manner in which the snatched loose is accomplished is as follows.  The bow is drawn and then there comes a pause, or rest, before full draw is reached.  This is immediately followed by full draw executed with a snatch that is as quick as lightening tot eh eye.  What the archer does to achieve this result is to draw until only a small portion of the arrow remains, and then, holding briefly for the count of one, he snatches the remaining portion of the arrow and loses with a snap of the fingers from the inside of the string. At the loose that part of the arrow which remained at the hold should have been grabbed back, as it were, with such rapidity as to be imperceptible to the bystanders, leaving them with the impression that the archer failed to bring the whole of the arrow to full draw. This is the finest and most practical loose for military purposes and when competing for distance.

The second form of loose, namely the held, is executed in the following manner. The full length of the arrow is drawn to its absolute limit, and, when the hands are motionless - by which is meant completely and utterly immobile - the arrow is released. In more precise terms, the archer should draw the arrow until there is nothing left to draw and then, [before loosing,]  hold with firm control For the count of one, two, or three, but no more. It is a good technique to adopt for shooting at a mark or at targets.

It is related that al-Hasan, when bringing the arrow to the centre of the bow, would say, ‘In the name of God' and that whenever he loosed, he would say, 'God is greatest’. It is also related that Idris ibn Yahyā said, 'As-Saffāh" once paid me a visit in the course of which he asked me whether I was an accurate shot. I replied that sometimes I was and sometimes I wasn’t. Whereupon he told me to say [upon drawing and releasing] “As God wills! There is no god but God, and there is no power apart from God!" He added that if I made these pronouncements, I would hit the mark and not miss, God willing. The archer should bear all this in mind as it will be a great help.

The archer should complete the operation by coolly and calmly forming a crescent (*muhallila*) with an upward twist (*farkah*) of the wrist (frontispiece). More explicitly, the position of his hand Immediately after release Should be such that his right index finger and thumb lie hard by his ear in the form of a crescent, this being achieved by an upward [and outward] twist of the wrist [that will reverse the position of the hand and thus leave the little finger uppermost. This action should be part of the loose and there should be no lag between the two] To accomplish the loose, the right index finger and then the thumb should be opened in rapid sequence, As far as the twist is concerned, it is essential that the movement should come from the wrist. One further point: the archer will find it a great help, when loosing, to open his middle finger along with his right index finger and thumb.

A number of advantages are to be gained from this technique: it will safeguard the right index finger against raps from the string, afford protection against a broken thumb-nail and bruising of the inside of the thumb, give a clean loose, and do no damage to the surface of the (leather) thumb-guard.

The loose should be accomplished with a backward punch (*laksah*), or thrust, of the right elbow as though the archer were jabbing someone behind with his elbow. Some archers open out the forearm (frontispiece) as they loose. The first method, however, is safer and sounder, especially in combat and confined spaces [because injury can be caused (presumably either to oneself or to a fellow archer standing close by) if the forearm and fingers are opened out in a confined space]. To close the fingers after the loose is a better and more practical technique in battle.
