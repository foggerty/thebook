# 17 - On bracing the bow (*itar al-qaws*)

Some masters in the art of shooting maintain that bracing the bow is a fundamental, while others consider it a secondary basis of archery. The former hold that any archer who is not proficient in bracing is incompetent, and in their eyes he is not a complete archer.

A bow may be braced in quite a number of ways, but here we shall confine our attention to the most useful,

613 A military method

The following procedure is a military technique. Grasp the prip of your bow with your left hand in such a way that you have the back, as opposed to the belly, which will be the side nearer to the string "when the bow is braced!,! facing you.? You put the nock? under the fourth tos of your left foot to prevent the loop of the string from slipping out when the bow is flexed ("inda n-naz’) for bracing. The fourth toe and little toe must then be wrapped over the loop and tensed.  At this point a very good tip must be noted: the archer can always secure the loop of his string to the nock ‘of the lower siyah? with a piece of thread to keep it from slipping out when bracing.  Your next step is to plant your right leg in an upright supporting position (between the bow and its string). This done, quickly and firmly set the belly of the arm (yad) of your bow—in other words, its longer half (sic), or upper limb, which is termed the ‘shooting limb’ (bayt ar-ramy)* and which is the section between the siyah and the grip—on to your right knee at a point close to the grip with the string resting on your calf. Now apply pressure to the bow with the palm of your right hand, holding the loop of the string in the ends of your fingers. The way to do this is first to grasp the grip of the bow with your left hand and the lower part of the upper siyah and the string with the right, the knot of the loop being heid in position between the right index finger and middle finger. You then grasp the middle of the sides of the loop with the ends of the index finger and thumb and apply pressure to the bow with the front of the right palm as you tense the right knee and left leg, at the same time pulling the left hand and grip towards you and pushing with the heel of the right hand until the loop slips into the nock in the siyah. Keep hold of the upper siyah and the loop of the bowstring to guard against the danger of the siyah’s springing round into its unbraced position (ingilab), for if one is in too much of a hurry to take his hand off the neck of a bow, it may, if too flexible or in any way twisted, spring round and perhaps break, doing harm, in any event, to the archer, Once the loop has been slipped into the nock in the siyah, the whole hand should be used to maintain a tight hold on them both until it is quite certain that they are properly in place and that the siyah has settled. Then the archer— whose hand ought never at any stage to have left the grip—should turn the bow with both hands, take the szyak of the lower limb in his right with the string towards his face, and examine the bow.  Should he find it to be out of true or twisted, he should correct it.

614Once the bow is braced, the necks should be adjusted and pressure applied to the stronger limb until the archer thinks the bow is as it should be.!*. Then, ‘grasping the bow with his left

band, as previously described,! he should take the centre of the string in all fingers of his right, and, if the bow is stable and not very much older than the string, draw it." If, on the other hand, the bow is much older than the stríng, or is twisted, or displays some characteristic that will be detrimental to it "when drawn!, he should leave it to settle to the string and later test it by draw- ing gently to see whether the necks have settled and whether the string is right for its draw- weight? or not. All tests of this kind, of course, are applicable only if the archer finds the bow to be true. Should he detect some twist in it, on the other hand, he should draw it only after adjusting it and leaving it for a while to settle.” If the twist is quite marked, he should defer bracing? until he has heated his bow on all sides over a gentle flame with the application of

rather more heat to the concave surface (batn) of the distortion and the belly (wajh) of the bow.  It should then be gently and lightly pressed into shape in a former (galab). To do this calls for dexterity, deftness, and technical skill, and great care must be taken to ensure that the bow neither springs round nor gets burned. How to correct a bow in this way is something every archer should know really well and be determined to master; for it is a great fundamental and an accom- plishment that none can aiford to ignore since a bow is prone to distortion and must be constantly watched. Care of this kind will keep a bow in condition and prolong its life. Sound shooting cannot be achieved with a bow that is not itself sound. Any archer, therefore, who cannot brace his bow properly and correct any irregular curves it may develop is incompetent, contemptible, unenterprising, and wholly unworthy of the name of archer.

618 Bracing on horseback

To brace a bow on horseback while charging "or wheeling!,!! grasp your bow as described in the preceding section, but bring it in against the horse’s neck. More precisely, set the neck of the lower limb against the base of the animal’s neck at the juncture of its neck and chest. The rest of the procedure is as already indicated in the last section.***

619If you wish to try a different method, lodge the neck of your bow quickly but securely in the instep of the right foot with the string in place and the grip pressed firmly against the outside of the right knee. Next bring your right hand to bear on the neck of the bow, that is to say, the base of the siyah and, with your left, draw the string up until you can slip it into the nock.


92 SAKACEN AKUCHERY

620 In other words, you put the lower siyah of the bow under the sole of your right foot, hold the upper styah with your right hand and the string with your left, and complete the operation in the manner described. If you wish to brace on the left side, the method is the same (mutatis mutandis),

By another method you can use your right hand to take hold of the neck to which the string has been fixed and hold the loop between your teeth.

Bracing under peaceful conditions In combat the few methods of bracing mentioned so far!* will be found by cavalry and infantry (as the case may be) to be the best, the most practicable, and the easiest to use. Under safer and more leisurely conditions, on the other hand, one good way of bracing is to sit cross-legged, putting the right leg inside the left. Seated squarely in this position, the archer fixes the loop of

623 in the nock of one of the styahs, but this time gives the free loop to someone near at hand. Taking the necks of the bow in both hands, he places the centre of the grip beneath his right knee!^* or, "better still,’ in behind both knees, and proceeds to flex the bow with both hands together. He then tells the person holding the free loop to slip it into the nock (Fig. 34). This done, he parts his legs inside the bow (thereby bringing his thighs to bear on the dustars) and sets the styahs as truly as he can, What he should do is to look at the stronger limb of his bow (i.e. the lower,

which is liable to bend less than the upper) and put more thigh against it, at the same time easing the thigh which is pressed against his weaker limb, 'but at no time allowing his hands to leave either neck!.*? He sits in this position for quite some time until he feels sure that the bow has settled. He then removes one thigh and looks, and, if he thinks that the bow has in fact settled, he may take out the other. If it has not, however, he should replace his thigh (and wait until it has).

625'This method of bracing is most suitable for bows that are apt to quiver and spin round and in cases where the bow is a good deal older than its string, It is also better for the bow. By applying this technique an intelligent man can bring his bow to the required curve without a bracing- board (kharkumán) either because he wishes to display his skill and knowledge or because the want of a bracing-board leaves him no alternative (Fig. 35).

A useful piece of equipment for bracing purposes is the barshag,!* which is a strap or cord with which the string is held fast to the weaker limb. "Two may be needed for one bow according to the requirements of the case.!!* If the bow, for instance, is a self bow and there is danger of one of the limbs giving way, a barshag should be applied to each limb to hold it in check.

A knowledge of things of this kind should be regarded by an archer as a sort of religious obligation because of the frequency with which the need to apply it will arise in combat and on campaign.

630Where one limb of a bow is weaker than the other, the stronger of the two should be heated over a gentle fire. If no fire is available, the archer should put his hand around it and briskly rub it up and down for a time until it gets warm, If fon campaign!!5 in winter when the weather is cold, his best policy is to put the bow inside his clothes and warm it with his body. When going to bed at night, he should also keep the bow inside his clothes to protect it against the damp.

When on campaign, an archer should never neglect his bow for a single moment, and in extremes of temperature he should inspect it ‘day and night, hour by hour, and not let it out of his mind, even though he be absolutely certain that it is stable and true, ° Moreover, he should Protect his hands against the cold in the early morning lest, needing to shoot, his limbs and fingers fail to respond, leaving him unable to shoot at all or, if able to do so, unable to equal his usual performance, This is a rule which should not be ignored, for ‘he who neglects to do what he ought, may repent when repentance will avail him not’,

Bracing a stiff bow

633The way to brace a stiff bow is to take the upper siyah with your right hand and, in a standing position, to place your right leg in between the bow and the string, keeping the bowstring on top of your shin and the belly of the bow against the rear of your right thigh beneath the hip- joint. You then put the tip of the lower siyak against the front of your left leg and, with your right hand on the upper siyah and your left hand holding the loop of the string, you push your right hand forward. You may, alternatively, hold the neck of the bow with your left hand, place the lower siyah against the front of your right leg, and, putting your left leg between the bow and the string, push with the left hand as you hold the loop in your right.

If the bow is too strong to be braced in this way, you should use a broad strap two cubits long and four fingers wide (about 4 ft. 4 in. x 3 in.). To the ends of this you fit two loops made of either bowstring or leather of the same sort as your string's chafing protector (saysarah).*° You next put the strap behind your back as you would when drawing a stirrup crossbow. If the bow has two nocks in each siyah, you put one loop in each nock., If your bow is not so made, however, you can have two hooks on your drawing-strap instead of two loops, or else secure the loops to the siyalis. Then, drawing with your waist, you push with your feet Tagainst the centre of the bow’s grip! ?! and attach the string. There is no need to enlarge on a subject which can be dismissed briefly once the gist is grasped. i

To brace in water, you put your head between the string and the bow with the bow’s grip on your shoulder ‘at the nape of your neck??? and each loop of string positioned in the centre of each neck, With a hand on each loop and neck you apply pressure with both palms together until the loops fall into the nocks in your styahs. Alternatively, you may hold each neck with your hands,

639 having one loop fixed in the bow and the other in your mouth, and then bend the bow with your hands until you get the nock which is in its siyak into the loop that is m your mouth. This requires a good deal of practice, but it is one of the finer points of bowmanship. If you propose to shoot, you hold your bow crosswise and use it in that position.


COMMENT

640 Bracing the highly reflexed Oriental bow can be difficult. Roughly C-shaped when unstrung, the weapon must be completely reversed for this purpose, As already noted in the introduction, the increased tension resulting from reversal adds considerably to the ultimate power and efficiency of such bows.

Although reflexed composites will tolerate a surprising degree of flexure, any unfair stress or strain can easily result in breakage, and for this reason bracing demands great care, The object of any method is to exert equal pressure on the two siyahs as the grip is forced in the opposite direction. i

641 I. Ways of Bracing s


So far as can be judged from Middle Eastern sources consulted by us, the ways of bracing a composite bow were far more numerous than our text might lead us to suppose. It was asserted by some authors that there were no less than one hundred, and a certain Muhammad ibn al- Hasan al-Harawi even wrote a work in which he described one hundred and twenty—imost of which, however, are said to have been repetitious and useless (Arab Archery, p. 29). While not proposing to follow al-Harawi's example, we nevertheless venture to illustrate the point by mentioning some methods not indicated in the preceding chapter. For convenience let us begin by comparing our ten with the twelve methods indicated in Arab Archery (pp. 30-37). These may be summarized as follows:

642 I. Pressure bracing (i). This is identical with Taybugha’s military method.

2. Pressure bracing (ii). The only difference between this and the preceding is that no extra support is given by the knee,

6433. Concealed bracing. This can be used by a bowman either on horseback or on foot. The lower siyah is placed against the outside of the thigh with the back of the bow towards the archer. With one hand he pulls the grip towards him and with the other pushes the upper siyah away from him. It is termed ‘concealed’ because the aim is to prevent an enemy on the side of the archer opposite to that on which he is bracing from observing his action. It may, of course, be carried out on either side.

4. Bracing of the fleeing archer. In this an archer facing a sword- or lance-thrust flees and, while running, braces his bow, its back towards him, by striking the ground with the lower siyah, pulling the grip with the left hand and pushing the upper siyah with the other, Alternatively, he may grasp the bow with its belly towards him and the lower siyah lying between his feet, In this case the grip is pushed forward with the left hand, and the neck of the upper limb pulled towards him. The first method is quicker, but the second better for the safety of the bow, As a bow can easily be broken by cither, we have not put it to the test.

6445. Bracing of the wounded archer. This is almost identical with Taybugha's first method of bracing a stiff bow, but only one hand need be used, the supposition being that the archer’s other hand or arm is out of action. The string is set in the lower nock, and the other loop around the upper neck of the bow as in the case of pressure bracing. The one hand then bends the bow and slides the loop into the upper nock. The archer shoots with one hand as he lies on his back, holding the grip between his feet.

through the left fully braced. Unfortunately, detailed instructions are not given.

647 . Bracing of the archers. This is the same as the method mentioned by Taybugha in which the


archer has an assistant to slip on the string.

648 . Bracing of the lone archer. This is the same, but the archer fits the string himself by flexing


the bow against one knee with both hands. He then holds one siyah in place with the other knee. The other siyah is held with one hand, while the opposite hand fits the loop into the nock.

649The bow is flexed across the back. The lower siyah goes between the legs and is held at the base of the thigh. One hand then pulls down on the upper siyah, and the other slips in the


string.  - The archer kneels on the left knee and stretches out his right leg. One siyah is set on the left

650 knee, the grip goes under the right leg, and the other siyah is pulled up with the hand.  The grip is taken in both hands and the siyaks pushed away with the two feet. The free loop is slid along by the appropriate foot until it slips into the nock,


One method to which there is no reference in our text, but which is described in MSS of the B group, is worthy of mention—due account being taken of some evident confusion between right and left. Holding one neck of the bow with its loop in place, the archer takes the other loop between his teeth. Passing the bow between his thighs, he Jodges it beneath the left and applies his left hand to the neck that is free, firmly setting the neck in his right hand on the right thigh, The neck once steadily in place on that thigh, the archer takes the loop from his teeth with the right hand, exerts pressure with the left, and slips the string in the nock located in the neck that is pressed against the left thigh. The great advantage of this method is stated to lie in the fact that the archer may put a stronger limb beneath his thigh to reduce its strength and in this way balance the two limbs, albeit after several attempts. The method could also be used by a horseman (B!, 60b-61a; B*, 49a-b).

2. The Relative Ages of Bow and String

655 When referring to the age of a bow in relation to its suing, Taybughà may have in mind either the fitting of a completely new string to a bow or the changing of a used string from one bow to another, In a new string there is usually a small degree of stretch to be removed. Normally this should come out within a few seconds of fitting it to the braced bow, which should then be care- fully watched lest a little too much stretch render it unstable. Should this happen, the string should be removed and shortened by adjustment of the loop-knots so that when it is fully stretched the length will be correct. Slightly more stretch can be expected to occur during the first few shots, after which the string should settle and no more adjustment be needed.

It will be recalled that the bracing height, or distance between the grip and the string of a braced bow, must be constant (above, p. 23). A small variation will affect both range and the direction in which the arrow leaves the bow. Slight though the effect may be, it is nevertheless sufficient to impair the.accuracy of the shot, and close attention is needed until the string is fully stretched and has been ‘shot in’, Since some stretch results from the tightening of newly tied loop knots, even a well-stretched string transferred from one bow to another might give a little if the loop-knots required adjustment as a result of difference in length between the two bows concerned.

3. Aids to Bracing

658 (a) Kharkuman. We do not know the exact form of this device, but there is almost no doubt that it was a bracing-board. The term is a loan word from the Persian compound Akar +kamān.  The latter presents no difficulty; it is the regular word for ‘bow’. The former has several meanings of which the most apt in this instance would appear to be ‘a bridge’ as for a stringed instrument.  The bracing device would consist of a board with a bridge, or central upright support, which


ON BRACING THE BOW 99

659 would be at right angles to the grip of the bow when raised in bracing. As can be seen from Fig. 35, in which we illustrate the general principle, the effect is comparable to that of a bridge raising the strings of a musical instrument. The support would be absolutely rigid and the top padded to avoid damage to the grip. Such a device could not be carried around by an archer, but it would be reasonable to expect its inclusion in the equipment of baggage-trains, arsenals, and bowyers’ workshops.

(b) Barshag, This term—also from Persian—appears to denote an appliance amounting to little more than a kind of binding to secure the string to the styak. It is defined in a, 66a, as ‘a strap or cord about one and a half spans (about 11 in.) in length. Once it was tied at the ends, the bow could be inserted, the purpose being to hold the weak limb’. The exact details of its application are uncertain, but it seems from this description to have been a kind of loop which could be slipped over the styah and tightened in some way.

660If one limb of a bow were unstable, there would be some advantage in securing the string to that limb for the purpose of bracing and retaining it until the bow settled. It could be that the barshag was so used, and that upon its removal the bow was immediately fit for use. Alternatively, it might have been applied and left awhile to correct a fault when it would have been inopportune to light a fire to remove some slight distortion by the application of heat.

A number of devices for correcting faults in bows are known to have existed, but here is not the place to accord them the space that would be required by a detailed discussion.

661 4. Defects in a Bow


Of the two major defects thar bracing may reveal, the first is weakness in the neck. Because of the form and shape of the bow, the neck has a natural tendency to lateral displacement. Its inherent stiffness normally militates against this, but if any weakness develops, it can occur. At best there will be slight lateral displacement of the neck so that its mid-line will not lie in the same plane as that of the string. When a braced bow is sighted from one end to the other, the string should appear to bisect the bow along its entire length. If, however, the neck is displaced it will not do so. Should side-warping of this kind not be detected and the bow be drawn, the defective limb will be subjected to a most severe twisting strain and possibly break.

662If the worst happens, the neck will twist violently round when the bow is braced, the string will slip past it, and the bow spring back to its unbraced form or capsize. Apart from the risk of damage to the bow, such an occurrence can have unpleasant consequences for the user, who may be struck with some force by one of the siyahs as it flies back. Hence the warnings given by our author to the archer to keep a firm grip on the bow until he is sure it is stable and has settled to the string.


5. Heat Treatment of Bows

663 Once a twist has developed in the limb of a bow, it may force the neck out of line with the results already described, and even if it does not do so, unfair strain will be thrown on to the bow.  Before bracing a composite bow, the archer should therefore assure himself of its soundness in this respect. To test it, he should hold it by one of its ends and align the two styahs. If, when viewed from end to end, they are in the same plane, the bow may be braced. If, on the other hand, they appear to cross each other, the defect must first be remedied,

Provided that the distortion is not excessive, correction presents little difficulty. After careful examination to decide the exact point of distortion the offending section is thoroughly warmed.  For this purpose there is nothing better than an open fire, and a dull charcoal fire is especially suitable (cf. Klopsteg, p. 89). The process is slow and gradual. Back and belly are alternately exposed to the fire for about half an hour until a pervasive warmth—not hotness—is achieved.  When subjected to such treatment, the materials become relatively pliable, and a firm correcting

664 100 SARACEN ARCHERY


twist may then be applied. To permit the bow to cool completely, an hour should be allowed, after which it can be re-examined. If it is stili not true, the process must be patiently repeated until it is.

665The curvature of the two limbs can be balanced in the same way. If imbalance.is present and cannot be corrected by the simple application of pressure after bracing, the stiffer limb must be warmed before bracing. The amount of heat required and the time allowed for the bow to warm are largely a matter of judgement based on experience, but with a little practice the technique is not difficult to master.


6. The Mould

666 If the distortion in a bow is excessive, it may not be possible to remedy the defect simply by heat and manipulation, and in these circumstances one has to resort to more forcible means such as the use of a mould. We do not know the nature of the mould used by the Mamelukes, bur, whatever its form, such a device would only be found in a baggage-train, arsenal, or craftsman's workshop. One kind of mould with which we are familiar is the Ottoman destgah, of which a line drawing may be seen in Hein, Fs}, XIV, p. 344 or Klopsteg, p. 52. Basically, it is a board in which a number of slots are cut to grip different parts of the bow. The bow would be warmed as for simple heat treatment, and the offending section placed in the appropriate slot. The archer or bowyer could then apply a very strong twist, which, as our author points out, must nevertheless be done carefully and adroitly. Whatever the form of mould used by the Mamelukes, the principle must have been the same as that of the destgdh, even though the device itself may have been more or less elaborate, There is a suggestion in our text that heat may have been applied while the bow was in the mould as the archer is warned not to burn the bow. This could be taken to imply that the bow was strapped to the mould after the application of a correcting twist, then heated rather more strongly, allowed to cool in the mould, and finally removed,

One would have thought that work of this kind was more a task for a craftsman than an archer.  It is interesting, therefore, that Taybughà expects the archer to be able to do it himself.
