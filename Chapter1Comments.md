## The Translators' Introduction

Archery is a religious obligation established in the Koran on the basis of Muhammad’s own explanation of sura viii. 62, where the word *guwwah* (‘force’) is taken to refer to archery.  The Prophet himself, furthermore, was an archer and possessed three bows. The terms in which he urged his community to practise riding and archery — preferably the latter — amount to a standing order, and archery is a *fard kifāyah* (i.e. a religious obligation incumbent, not upon each individual, but upon the community by representation). When his Companions engaged in archery contests, the Prophet used to attend and would support one or other of the contending parties.

Certain authors relate that Adam, after being sent down from paradise, was commanded to raise crops. Two birds ate what he sowed, and so he complained to God, who sent Gabriel with a bow, a string, and two arrows. Being asked what these things were, Gabriel explained, as he handed them over, that the bow was the force (*quwwah*) of God, the string was the might (*shiddah*) of God, and the arrows the harm to be inflicted (*nikāyah*) by God. He then taught Adam to shoot, whereupon he killed the birds. Knowledge of archery then passed to Abraham, Ishmael and Isaac, and archery is indeed the legacy of these illustrious ancestors.

There is an authentic tradition of the Prophet that it is a sin to give up archery after learning the art. There are, furthermore, numerous traditions of the Prophet which commend archery.  He himself used to preach, leaning on a bow, and considered that there was no better weapon.  Gabriel had an Arab bow on the day of the battle of Uhud (fought between Muhammad and the tribe of Quraysh to the north of Medina, March, A.D. 625). The excellence of the bow is the subject of many traditions of the Prophet, which are too numerous for inclusion in the present work.
