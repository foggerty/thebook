# 19 - On flight shooting (*ramy as-sibāq 'alā bu'd al-masāfah*)

If, in shooting, it is your wish to outdistance your competitors you should use a bow with short *dustārs* and choose a light arrow. It has already been remarked that flight bows should have short *dustārs* or, in other words, be shorter in the working limbs than ordinary bows, have long necks, and be quick to recover *(sari'at ar-rujū')* upon removal of the string (i.e. have greater resilience than the ordinary bow). Enough, too, has already been said about the kind of arrows to be used. We need only add that the lighter the arrow, the greater its range. The lightest flight arrows in our experience weigh six *dirhams* (285.6 gr.). They break easily and can only be used by really first-class bowmen, for if the archer, in locking, subjects an arrow of this kind to pressure, or if, upon loosing, he tilts the top of his bow or twists the grip, he will break it. Flight shooting, in fact, clearly demonstrates whether an archer knows his business or not, and shows up his proficiency or incompetence in the art of bowmanship.

It is generally agreed that in flight shooting you should keep the sun and wind behind you and stand obliquely with legs apart, Stand on your right leg, all the time keeping the left at ease, for although both legs have a part in the stance, it is the right that should take the weight as the left is held at ease [from the moment the draw begins until the loose is actually completed]. It is a good idea, therefore, to put your left foot up on to a stone or something that will serve the same purpose.

[The moment he begins to draw] the flight shooter should tilt the foot of his bow forwards and bring up his bow-hand until he reaches the point where half the sky is exactly halved. In other words, he should find the point of elevation that lies half-way between the zenith and the horizon; for if the hand is raised beyond or below that point, some loss of range will result.  Great care must therefore be taken to determine the right elevation and to set the bow at the correct angle. For precise reckoning the archer should take an elevated object of the appropriate height or a spot of the same altitude and use it as a guide.

Given a perfect draw and loose, you will succeed in outstripping other competitors and take the prize if you follow my advice. Instructions relating to the draw and loose have already been given. It remains only to note that the greater the draw, the greater the distance attained.

For perfect flight performance the archer should lock the arrow without exerting pressure on any part of the nock and, having drawn with true alignment [of arms, shoulders, fists, and shaft]  as fully as the ‘greater draw’ (*wafā’ nihāyah*) permits, loose with a rapid snatch and twist accompanied by a [forward] and upward thrust [against the grip] as he spreads his chest and arms.  Some flight shooters move forward a little and release while still in motion, accompanying the action with a hard stamp of the left foot. This technique is a great asset to anyone who can train himself to it and really carry out our instructions in the proper manner. It will, however, thoroughly discredit a man if he doesn't know how to apply it correctly and will result in a poor distance. The real art lies in having a fully drawn arrow at the moment of loosing and simultaneously timing the actions of stamping, chest expansion, and inspiration to coincide with the departure of the arrow from its true nocking-point at the base of the thumb-lock. The slightest deviation from this ideal will result in a bad shot.

Certain advantages are to be derived from flight shooting. For instance, it teaches an archer not only to appreciate the significance of atmospheric conditions, but also to draw a taut bow and develop a sharp, clean loose. Furthermore he wil! learn to attain maximum range and effectiveness, which is what is wanted in warfare, especially when it comes to siege operations. It does, on the other hand, have its drawbacks in that it can reduce his degree of accuracy and precision in shooting, impair good grouping (*jam'*), increase his expenditure and debt, and bequeath a legacy of enmity between archers and their nearest and dearest.

Among the most cunning tricks that can be played when shooting flight arrows is one in which the archer drills a hole through the shaft near the fletching and plugs the hole when making his own shot, but clears it when it is his opponent’s turn to shoot. Another trick is to drill down the centre of the shaft from inside the nock and to leave the hole open when shooting himself, but to fill it with a metal plug when it is his opponent's turn. These tricks, of course, can only be played when it is stipulated that the shooting be done with one bow and one arrow. The use of such practices makes the acceptance of any prize illegal because it is cheating and not permitted by the law. An impertinent, hard-faced, and impudent character, however, can use such means to great effect without the application of any great skill.

The subject of sharp practices puts me in mind of the story of a Persian archer in Khwārizm (or, Khwārazm; Kharezm) whose story is as follows. ‘I had heard’, he said, ‘that an archer in Nishapur was shooting short flight arrows, so I went out and spent several days looking for him.’  In the course of the search he suddenly came upon a man on horseback carrying a bowcase containing a bow and arrows. ‘So we sat talking,’ he went on, ‘and the time for the mid-day prayer came round, so the man got up to perform his ablution before prayer.’ When he had gone I took a look inside the man’s bowcase and was surprised to find that it contained some flight arrows measuring about six and a half fists (*qabdahs*; i.e. about 21 in.) in length. Two fists were of reed (*gasab*), two of *khalanj* wood (Cornelian Cherry?), two of brazil-wood (*baqqam*), and the remaining half fist of *yānur*, or ibex horn. Having looked at them, I put them back and then found that there was also an arrow-guide (*mjrāt*) with them. When the man returned, I remarked “I suppose you are good at shooting short flight arrows?" “Yes,” he replied, “with the aid of an arrow-guide (*majrā*).” He then showed me his bow, and I found two beads of lead on his bow- string. “Shall I do you a good turn?" I asked. “Since you are so kind,” he replied. So I said, “Let me then give you these twenty dinars and this nag [in exchange for your equipment] and you will return safe and sound, for I pity you arriving in Khwārizm with this collection of tackle!  They will be up in arms against you and really put you through it.” Whereupon he agreed to my suggestion and was delighted with me.’

This story is clear enough to require no long explanation. We shall come back to that later.  (Note, the author never actually returned to this story.)
