796 COMMENT 1. Basic Considerations


This useful chapter summarizes the teaching expounded earlier in the work and introduces the reader to certain important aspects of advanced technique. The novice, once having mastered the basic methods in which he has been trained, is ready to proceed to the development of an individual style of shooting. The pattern of progression is as valid today as it was in the time of

Taybughà. When he first learns to shoot, the beginner experiences a sense of awkwardness and is more often than not confused by his attempts to memorize ail the various details essential to sound performance. With practice most points become a matter of automatic behaviour, and when some degree of proficiency has been attained, he 1s almost sure to feel the need for certain minor variations. He should be encouraged to satisfy this need under the watchful eye of a competent master who will prevent him from developing some radical error which at a later stage it might be difficult to correct. A good master thoroughly familiar with all possible variations should quickly perceive his pupils’ problems and advise them to take up certain styles calculated to bring them to a mastery of their art.

798The need for variations arises almost entirely from the physical characteristics of the individual archer, and, as Taybughi so rightly observes, no two men are exactly alike. Basically, it is not.  unreasonable to consider, as Taybughà does, the two extremes, between which limits wide variations can be found,


2. The Draw

799 In shooting a bow the archer has what amounts to a foresight formed by the combination of the arrow's point and the side of the bow. The manner in which he uses this sight depends on whether he aims ‘inside’ the bow or ‘outside’, but in either case there is a definite object to be aligned with the target. A trained archer may not be conscious of what he is doing, and it may even be said that alignment of his sight should be a reflex operation. Since there is no backsight, it is essential, for the attainment of constant direction, that the tail of each and every arrow always be drawn to the same point. If the point is allowed to vary, the line of the arrow in relation to the line of sight will also vary, and shooting wili of necessity be erratic.

The modern archer positively ‘anchors'\—to use the accepted technical term—his drawing hand either under his chin or against the side of his mouth according to his adopted technique.  There are many variations, but what is essential and common to all is that the archer should feel his drawing hand firmly pressed into place in the chosen position. This method of anchoring is relatively modern and has been successfully developed over the last century or so. By contrast, there is the traditional Japanese technique whereby the drawing hand is brought back beyond the head and roughly above the point of the right shoulder. In this case there is no positive lodgment of the hand. A constant position can nevertheless be achieved by the shaft’s lightly touching against the cheek, and with practice an unvarying length of draw is attainable. The Mameluke technique with which we are here concerned seems to be more akin to the Japanese than to that of the modern Western archer. In other words, there appears to be no anchor as understood by the latter. However, that may be, ‘anchor’ is a conventent term to apply to the position of the draw- hand at the moment of loosing, and for this reason we shall use it in the present context in

800t sense.


3. Anchoring

801 ‘Drawyng to the eare he [Homer] prayseth greatly, whereby men shoote both stronger and longer: drawynge therefore to the eare is better than to drawe at the breste... Holdynge must not be longe, for it bothe putteth a bowe in ieopardy, & also marrcth a mans shoote . . k (Ascham, p. 105).


Drawing to the lobe of the ear is commended by the author of Arab Archery as a time-honoured practice compatible with accurate and effective shooting, and drawing to the white spot between the lobe of the car and the beard is declared to be almost as good (p. 51). Neither of these choices, however, he regards as the best. On the contrary, he advocates drawing to the end of the right jaw-bone and running the arrow along the lips or moustaches.,

802 ON ADJUSTMENTS REQUIRED BY DIFFERENT PHYSIQUES 127


Whatever the options open to the individual, there is one rule from which the archer should not depart if he is to draw a strong bow: he must not anchor at a point below the level of his shoulders. For military archery the ear has always been a favoured position. To draw to the ear does not necessarily imply that the hand should be in contact with it, but rather that it should be brought back as far as the limit set by the ear. Contact was not always made by the drawing hand, and, in fact, the anchor-point often lay below the lobe as it was obviously to do in the case of Taybugha’s tall man, whose shaft would be drawn at a level half-way between lip and chin until the drawing hand came as far back as the lobe of his ear. It is not stated that at this stage the shaft should lightly touch the face, or that some part of the drawing hand should be in contact with the jaw or neck. Nevertheless, something of the kind would seem to be a highly desirable, if not necessary, safeguard against any lateral variation in the position of the arrow’s nock. It should also be noted that the tall man would need to have his head turned slightly to the right of his line of sight in order to shoot in comfort (Fig. 42).

803At the other extreme, the short man is advised to draw with the shaft at a level which would be roughly that of the tip of his nose. Since he is to stand or squat squarely, he can face the target directly, but this attitude will prevent him from setting his shoulders in line with the mark. It naturally follows that he must angle his left arm at the shoulder as he trains his bow on the target. Angling of the arm in this way will not only prevent him from exploiting his strength to the Tull as the tall man can do, but it will also affect his methed of gripping the handle over and above the degree to which it is already affected by adjustments necessitated by the physical dimensions of his hand (Fig. 42b). For the rest, the anchor-point of his drawing hand will be on, or near, the lobe of his ear.


4. Terminology

804 The enigmatic yocabulary used to denote the various positions of the draw presents a problem to which the best solution seems to be that which we are about to propose. Based on a careful study of all relevant details known to us at the time of writing, it takes account not only of information contained in our Chapters II and 23, but also of data located as follows in CD: (i) C1, 44b; C3, 73a; C^, 36b; D', 32a; D?, 59b; fii) C!, 73a-b; C?, 116a-117a; C3, 61a-b; (iii) C! 68a-69b; C}, 1092-1115; C?, 572-582; D, 49a-51a; D*, 732-742.

The need for brevity precludes here the scrutiny of minutiae. Certain observations must, however, be made. Firstly, in certain fundamental respects the evidence of (1), into which textual corruption almost certainly enters, directly contradicts that of (ii), which more closely agrees with what our accepted text of the present chapter has to offer. Secondly, in one important respect, viz. the expression applicable to the draw prescribed for an archer of medium proportions, the evidence of (ii) is in conflict with that of (iii), and, in fact, the same discrepancy—bayad in the one case as against sawäd in the other—will, upon comparison of the present chapter with the next, be found to exist in our own text. Thirdly and lastly, from the literature of which we have first-hand knowledge we can only conclude that certain archers or authors, or both, either used identical terms in different senses, or else misunderstood or misapplied their terminology, or give the appearance of having done so, because of changes in usage or extensions of meaning.

805Whatever the uncertainties of interpretation in respect of particulars, it is our opinion that from a general standpoint there are two classes of terminology to be distinguished: (2) that pertaining to the position of the arrowhead in relation to the grip of the bow, viz, bidaya, kifáyah (above, p. 57), niháyah, nikāyah; (b) that bearing on the movement and position of the drawing hand in relation to the face, viz. (al-)bayád, (as-)sawdd, kashf (al-)bayád, n(V ?)sah al-qabdah|(al-) bayad}(as-} sawad. :

A major hurdle in the way of our immediate disentanglement of this terminological skein proved to be the ambiguity of gabdah, which prima facie could be taken in the context as (a) ‘grip,

806 128 SARACEN ARCHERY


handle’ of the bow; (b) ‘bow-hand’; (c) ‘drawing hand’, After the elimination, on technical grounds, of alí but the last of these meanings, the next step was to determine the nature of the evident, but perplexing, contrast between bayad (lit. ‘white, whiteness’) and sazad (lit. ‘black, blackness’) which—again on technical grounds—we felt obliged to dissociate from the grip of the bow or the bow-hand in favour of the drawing hand or face. Since there is an obvious contrast between the ‘clean’ and bearded parts of the face, we finally decided that it was to these that our terms referred. The last major problem lay in mVsah. The meaning of the root msk ‘wipe, rub’ being clear enough, it was a question of settling for one of three different MS readings, viz, misáh, masáh, or massáh, the last being least common. On a number of grounds we decided in favour of the first, which, by analogy with kashf in the expression k, al-bayàd (ii, below), we take to be a verbal noun. In this verbal noun there inheres the idea of ‘endeavouring to wipe one thing against another', and how it fits into the picture will be seen in the explanations we now offer:

807

(i) The tail man draws his shaft on the tuft of hair between lip and chin, then passes his hand over his beard to reach the anchor-point below the ear at the angle of the jaw. His action in so doing is an attempt, against the pull of the bow, to wipe his drawing hand (misa I-gabdahk) on his beard, or alternatively, to wipe his beard (misah* s-sawad) with his drawing hand. Misdh used absolutely would appear to be an abbreviated form of one or other of the two. At the other end of things the arrowhead is in the first position (bidáyaA), safely projecting perhaps as much as two inches beyond the bow because of his use of the square grasp (Fig. 44a).

809(ii) The short man draws on his cheek (baydd), then reaches back to his anchor-point marked by the lobe of his ear. His action in so doing is that of revealing his cheek, or the ‘white’ (kaskf?  i-bayad). His arrowhead is in the ultimate position (mhdyah), or as far back as it can safely be drawn, since his use of the oblique grasp enables him to bring it on to the side of the bow's


grip (Fig. 44b).

case usually being described as bidáyah. For this there could be several explanations, every one of which would be sheer hypothesis and make tedious reading. It is sufficient to say that misah® (I-) bayad, whether it be as suggested above or taken as a kind of compound expression incorporat- ing misāh from (i) and bayád from (ii) above, makes perfectly good sense to us. As regards the arrowhead, it is in the position that may be described as ‘just right" (Exfayak).

811Finally, if any archer, whatever his proportions, exceeds the specified draw by reaching back beyond the lobe of his ear, his arrowhead may come inside the grip and be in a position to do him
