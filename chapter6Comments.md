It is regrettable that Taybugha should be so brief on such an important subject. The author of Arab Archery is much more informative and offers some interesting details on the making of horn and leather thumb-guards (pp. 123-24).


### Construction of the Guard

**The leather guard**

This was made from a T-shaped piece of leather. The ends of the horizontal portion were carefully sewn together to form a loop into which the thumb could fit, while the stem was left to cover the inside of the pad at the end of the thumb. The thumb-tip and knuckle remained uncovered, The authot’s assertion that the loop must fit the thumb is fully supported by experience. If it is too tight, discomfort results at the draw and, if too loose, it is liable to be pulled off by the bowstring upon release. It is also clear that the length and shape of the lip need to be tailored to the requirements of the individual. A fine leather lining and a lip like a smail broad bean is recommended in Arab Archery, whose author adds that a slight groove should be impressed into the surface of the leather (p. 123). This, presumably, would follow the crease of the thumb and would make for consistent positioning of the string during shooting.

**The drawing-ring**

The manufacture of a drawing-ring clearly required far more care and attention than the leather guard, In existing specimens the hole into which the thumb fits is slightly oval so that the ring has to be turned through ninety degrees from its final position to slip over the thumb-joint. When finally turned to its shooting position, it cannot possibly slip off the thumb if the fit is correct. The shape of the inner surface depends on the contour of the thumb. If too little of the inside of the lip is cut away, the string will put excessive pressure on the inside of the thumb, while if too much is cut away it may be very difficult to retain the string on the inner upper surface of the ring during the draw. The curves of the inner and outer surfaces of the lip are, to some extent, complementary, and their design must be balanced against the shape of the thumb for which they are made. A ring would therefore have to be made to measure by a careful craftsman with an eye for detail, and all existing examples show this to have been the case. A well-fitting ring is a pleasure to use, and there can be no doubt that a really successful one would have been highly prized by its owner.

The archer pays great attention to the exactness of the grip upon the string, for even the smallest variation can affect a shot. The position of the fingers or the thumb relative to the string is to some extent a matter of personal preference according to the best results obtained by the individual.

We shall sec in due course that the archer is recommended to take the string in the crease formed by the thumb-joint, or else a fraction either above or below it towards the tip of the thumb. In any of these positions the string can lie either straight across the thumb or at a slight angle. Given all these variations, to say nothing of the relative position of the tip of the thumb on the middle finger and the forefinger upon the thumb, it can readily be seen how faults can occur when using a leather guard. The worst fault is Jack of absolute consistency in even the most minute detail of one's hold or lock upon the string.

Archers will be aware that a good, clean, and unvarying loose of the string is difficult to achieve and demands constant practice and attention to detail. Until this is mastered shooting will be erratic. The importance of this aspect of shooting cannot be overemphasized.

With the ring, wide variations do not occur, and it is easier to be consistent. The two main reasons for this are that the string can rest only in one position, and the movement of the tip of the thumb across the middle finger is limited by the lip of the ring. Hence our author's statement that the ring will be preferred by the inferior archer.

Several years’ experience of shooting with a leather guard permits the view that it gives its user superior control and that the archer who has mastered the technique, will, if shooting for accuracy, outshoot an opponent who is using a ring. It should, however, be noted that for flight shooting the ring gives a sharper release and is therefore to be preferred for that purpose.
