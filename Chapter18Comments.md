102 SARACEN ARCHERY COMMENT

672 Strict adherence to the Arabic text would require our chapter to be entitled ‘On Standing and Sitting Before the Target’, but, as none of the MSS of the A group deals with the second of these two subjects, we have excluded ‘and Sitting’ from our English title. The subject will be taken up in section 2 below.


1. Standing

673 The oblique, frontal, and intermediate positions are discussed in Arab Archery, pp. 81-84, where they are said to have been the positions of Abū Hashim, Tahir, and Ishaq, respectively:

(a) The position of acute obliqueness, Known in Great Britain and the United States as the sideways position, this is quite rightly said to permit a longer and more powerful draw. The bow arm can be fully extended, and the unrestricted use of the back- and shoulder-muscles permits the application of maximum strength. It enabled the oriental archer discharging his arrow from the right of his bow to hold a shield while shooting. This important advantage resulting from the use of the thumb-lock would be denied to users of the three-finger method as practised in the West, for the arrow leaving the bow from the [eft would have to pass between bow and shield with resulting interference from the latter. To shoot with a shield was perhaps not as simple for the Oriental as one might suppose. Of the various types of shield in use in the Middle Ages, that most current in the area with which are concerned was too deeply concave on the inside to permit both the grip of the shield and the handle of the bow to be held in one hand without some kind of supporting device. To overcome the difficulty, the archer's most practical approach would have been to slide his forearm through the shield's grip and to support it by means of a shield-strap, or guige. This would have been fastened to two of the four rings which one normally finds inside the boss and then hung around the neck to afford additional Support against the rim. The guige need have been nothing more than a silk scarf. Such an expedient was used by mounted warriors as a means of carrying a shield when not in use. (For helpful advice in this matter we are indebted to H. R. Robinson of H.M. Tower of London Armouries.)

674(b) The frontal position. The advantages of this position were said by its advocates to lie in increased accuracy and the fact that it permitted the user to wear a coat or two of mail which would crowd the tip of the bow if shot in the oblique position, Although the author of Arab Archery concedes its merits for a near target, trick-shooting, and weak bows, he warns his readers that it will shorten one’s draw, weaken one’s shot, and not allow the use of a shield.

(c) The intermediate position. This is said to combine the advantages of the other two without having the disadvantages of either. It is advocated as the best standing position for warfare and

675 other purposes, 2. Sitting

In the terminology of Arabic-speaking archers ‘sitting’ (julüs) seems to denote almost any posture that is not standing or lying, In many contexts it is best translated as ‘squatting’.

676As in the case of standing, the positions could be oblique, frontal, or intermediate. Four different seats are described in the chapter on sighting in MSS of the -C group (C!, 482-b; C?, 78b-79a; C*, 40a-b; cf. D1, 36a; D?, 62a). They are:

(a) The sprinter's seat (jalsat al-hárib). The archer bends his right knee, digs it into the ground to take his weight (D: and sits on his foot). His left shank he keeps erect (D: but bent slightly over to the right). It is Abii Hashim’s method and was that of most of the ancients and the Persians. It may be used the opposite way round, It is a good position that is suitable for users of a strong bow or novices.

677 ON STANDING BEFORE THE TARGET 103


(b) The fencer’s seat (jalsat al-muthàgif). The archer rests on his ieft shank which is raised but with the knee pointing towards the ground. He keeps his right erect. The feet are kept apart the length of the bone of the forearm or less, and his weight is distributed between the two.

678(c) Innominate. The archer squáts on his raised feet, ankles together. The shanks remain erect. It is suitable for persons with deep chests or persons using the oblique position. Most archers use it, and it is convenient for a man in armour,

(d) The kings’ seat (jalsa al-mulük). This is described as a ‘square seat’ (jalsah murabba'ah), meaning that the user is square to the target and not sideways. It could, perhaps, mean *cross- legged’—as interpreted, it would seem, in Arab Archery, p. 85. It is suitable for men with deep chests, for trick-shooting, and for use with a light bow.

679The foregoing postures are described in more or less the same terms by the author of Arab Archery, who interestingly remarks that (c) was used by most archers in Khorasan and Egypt, and that (b) was the posture adopted by most Andalusian archers (pp. 84-85).
