# 12 - On sighting (*nazar*)

When sighting the mark, turn your eyes so that the lines of vision of both eyes merge and the two eyes become as one, and a single object is seen in the same way as it would be with one eye only.  The reason for this recommendation is that the use of both eyes gives a stronger vision.  it is, however, apt to be attended by inequality of vision, and in most cases a person will see a single object in two different places or as two separate objects.  This indeed is what will happen when he views a distant object in line with some part of the raised hand; for in the majority of cases a person will, under such circumstances, see the object at which he is looking with a master eye (lit. 'with one of his eyes having strong vision than the other').  [If the left eye is the master,] he will see his hand with his right eye to the left of the [object, while if the right eye is the master he will see it] with his left eye to the right [of the object.]  If, on the other hand, there is equality of vision in both eyes, he will aim with first one, and then the other, without the ability to co-ordinate, not knowing in his bewilderment where the true line of vision lies.  The knack lies in turning the eyes askant so that the line of vision of the one shifts into that of the other by bringing the pupil of the left eye into its exterior angle (*muqaddam*).  He can then aim with them bot as though with one eye.  Sighting of this kind is termed *akwal* ('squint eyed') and is particularly good.  It is a difficult technique to master, but for a horseman or a man in armour it is a valuable asset.  It is furthermore, the ancient for of sighting used by the Chosroes (i.e. the Sasanids, A.D. 226-651).

If you are unable to sight with both eyes, then close one eye as you take aim so that you see the target as it really is.  This should only be done at the very moment the arrow is released and with such alacrity that it is not noticeable to the person aiming.

Each form of sighting just described calls for careful practice until it is mastered and it becomes a habit.

The art of sighting can be acquired in the following manner.  Using either one or both eyes, train your sight on a lamp, and any disparity of vision which you may experience will become apparent to you.  What you do first is to place a lamp at a distance.  Then, taking a gentle bow, you squat in a position between the oblique and the square (i.e. frontal) just as you do when addressing yourself to the mark from the squatting position.  You next nock an arrow an align its head with the flame, all the time pulling on (*naza'a fi l-qaws*) the bow.  While doing so, you keep one eye closed and the other open, then open both together and draw to the limit of the arrow, all the while keeping your sight on the light until the disparity is corrected to your satisfaction.

Sight the target outside the bow from the back of the hand. What constitutes the outside of the bow is a controversial point. Some say that to sight outside the bow means setting your sight along the arrow and that to sight inside the bow is to sight from the back of the hand because it lies between the bow and the archer. The correct understanding of the term is as stated [in the opening sentence of this paragraph] because the inside of the bow is the space between the bow and its string. So, properly speaking, internal sighting will be that which is carried out by means of the arrowhead (i.e. as seen between the bow and the string), and to draw conclusions on the subject from a picture of Bahrām Gūr [as some who take the contrary view do] is of little use, because a picture on a wall or in a book is not large enough to show such detail.

External sighting can be done in three ways. In one of these you look askance with both eyes as described above. By a second variation the arrowhead lies outside the bow in line with the mark, while the archer looks at the mark with both eyes and aims with the left. He then rapidly snatches the arrow and releases. Thirdly, he can train the arrowhead on the mark outside the bow. In this case he uses his left eye to aim and keeps his right on the *dustār* of the bow without using it to sight any part of the mark, keeping the knuckles of the left hand in line with the centre of the mark.

You can also sight by split vision. This is done by training the arrowhead on the mark with the left eye outside the bow and coming into focus by directing your right eye on to the mark from inside the bow. Never take your right eye off the arrowhead or your left from the mark at which the arrow is to be loosed.

[You may adopt a variation of this method as follows.] First, you use both eyes to train the arrow on the mark outside the bow. Then, when only one-third of the arrow remains to be drawn and the arrowhead disappears from sight [behind the bow,] you keep the left eye trained on the mark and with the right watch inside the bow for the arrowhead to come on to your hand.  When the arrowhead is as far back as it can go at full draw, you release, This is an excellent method and is, furthermore, the most accurate and the least confusing of all. Those who practise the technique adopt a squatting position between the square and oblique postures

Some archers gauge elevation and direction (*wazana*) from the beginning of the draw and make continual adjustments until the moment of release. What you do in this case is to train the arrowhead on to the mark, gauge precisely, and draw, training your sight along the left forearm with both elbows evenly and correctly balanced. This is Tāhir’s method. Alternatively, you can sight the mark first and, when you have drawn half the arrow, gauge precisely and at that instant bring the arrow to full draw and release. This is a more careful method. Others only gauge at the end. In other words, elevation and direction are not precisely gauged (*lā yatahaqqaq al-wazn*) at the beginning of the draw. On the contrary, the archer waits and, when a fist’s length of the arrow remains to be drawn, he holds for a moment, sights, and then, snatching rapidly, releases.  This is the military technique, and it is of far greater value than any of those already described,

You may also gauge by taking the process right through from the moment you begin to draw until full draw is reached, but then giving a quick release. This is an excellent method for target shooting, but it is best to accustom oneself to military techniques.

To hit an enemy at some distance away, aim at his head [by elevating the upper limb of the bow], for an arrow loses height on its way to the mark. [If aimed in this way, however,] it will find its way into your adversary and kill him. To get your arrow into an enemy at close range, on the other hand, you should aim for his leg [because in the first stage of its flight after leaving the bow an arrow gains height]. You can in this way make allowances for different distances between the two extremes, Some archers say that if you cover your opponent with your left fist and shoot, you will kill him, but this is only true if one is at a certain specified distance. Archers hold different opinions about the angle of ascent and velocity of an arrow. Judgement and length of experience, however, are the only real means of obtaining the best results,

All that we have said so far depends for its success on a steady left hand, a firm hold on the grip, correct locking, alignment of both arms, correct sighting, presence of mind, a sound draw with the [right] elbow in the appropriate position, a clean release with tension in both elbows and, above all - for on this hinges everything else - imperturbability.
