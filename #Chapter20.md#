# 20 - The list of thirty-four points

## Wherein Lie the Secrets of Archery As Noted by Certain Great Masters

An archer does not merit the title and status of master (*ustādh*) until be is truly competent and has perfect control over such parts of the body as should be tensed, relaxed, or still, as the case may be; until he not only has a thorough knowledge of the faults caused by tensing parts that should be relaxed (*tashdid al-layyin*) and relaxing parts that ought to be tensed (*talyin al-mushaddad*) and allowing movement where stillness is called for (*tahrik as-sākin*), but is also fully acquainted with the injuries an archer can sustain together with their causes; until he can appreciate differences of stature, the structure of the limbs, and differences in their length; until he is quite familiar with techniques that can either make or mar a man’s shooting, and is conversant with the differences of opinion held by authorities on these matters. In the various parts of the body there are thirty-four points to be considered.

Of these, *twenty* are *points of tension*:

In the right arm there are *eight*:
1. The little finger;
2. The ring-finger;
3. The middle finger;
4. The thumb;
5. The wrist;
6. The elbow;
7. The upper arm;
8. The muscle in the upper part of the forearm.

In the *left arm* there are *six*:
1. The little finger;
2. The ring-finger;
3. The middle finger;
4. The wrist;
5. The elbow;
6. The muscle in the lower part of the forearm.

In the *body* there are *six*:
1. The right flank;
2. The right shoulder;
3. & 4. Each of the shoulder-blades;
5. The spinal column;
6. The belly.

*Eleven* are *points of relaxation*:

In the *right arm* there are *two*:
1. The index finger;
2. The middle sinew of the forearm.

In the *left arm* there are *three*:
1. The index finger;
2. The thumb;
3. The head of the forearm (i.e. the carpal, or wrist, end of the radius).

In the *body* there are *four*:
1. The left shoulder;
2. The left side;
3. The waist;
4. The neck.

In the *head* there are *two*:
1. & 2, The lips.

Three are points of stillness:
1. The heart;
2. &3, the eyes.

If a state of relaxation supervenes in any point of tension, or a state of tension in any point of relaxation, the archer will find that certain faults and injuries follow according to the nature of his error. Thus, if tension at any point in the left arm is allowed to lapse into relaxation, pain in the palm of the hand and blistering ('*aqr*) of the fingers can result. Slashing of the bow-hand (*infitāg al-qabdah*) and distressing contusion of the wrist (*taznid*) arise from the same fault which, apart from causing the bowstring to strike the wrist, also reduces the range of the arrow.

Should the thumb of the left hand be tensed, the proximal phalanx of the thumb will blister.  If the index finger of this hand is tensed, the arrow will fly high and miss the mark - a good thing in flight shooting, but thoroughly bad in target shooting. If the left wrist is relaxed, splitting (shagq) of the skin can occur between the thumb and index finger as well as blistering of the arrow-guide formed by the thumb and of the proximal phalanx of the thumb. The grip of the bow will also turn in the hand, and the bowstring twang to no purpose. If the left elbow is relaxed, twisting and tremor (*irti āsh*) of the forearm will result, the length of the draw will be reduced (ie. when the arrow is supposedly at full draw), and traction will be poor. The left shoulder must be relaxed, for if it is tensed, it will move upwards, and the bowstring will strike it.  This results in the arrow’s slapping the arrow-pass (*tadmik*) [with consequent deflection], a wagging arrow (*la'b*), or breakage of the shaft at the fletching, and causes the string to hit the tip of the thumb of the drawing hand.

As regards locking, relaxation of any part for which tension has been indicated can result in broken skin in the locking-fingers and a bruise (*sawād*) on the inside of the thumb and cause the String to hit the tip of the thumb of the drawing hand.

If the right index finger (*shahādah*) is tensed, a bruise will come up on the inside of the thumb, blood will collect under the nail, and the nail will break. Loosing will not be easy, and the string will rap the end of the right index finger. If the right wrist is relaxed, pain will pccur there, and traction will be poor.

If the right elbow is relaxed, creeping (*zaqq*) will result, the elbow will drop, and the arrow fly high (?; the contrary is true) and away from the mark. If the right upper arm is relaxed, the bowstring may come away from [the base of] the nock, the shaft will slap the arrow-pass (*dimak*), the arrow gad at the end of its course, and the bowstring rap the forearm [and chest].  If the right shouldcr is relaxed, the length of the draw will be shortened, accuracy diminished, and the bowstring will rap the chest. Other results will be a sluggish loose (*futūr al-itlāq*) and loss of range.

If the neck is tensed, the effect will be tremor. If the lips are tense, there will be distortion of the archer’s expression. The eyes should be still, for if they are strained, they will stray and go out of focus. The back must be straight and firm, for if it is relaxed, stooping *inhinā*) will result, traction will be poor, the bowstring will rap the chest, and the arrow will gad at the end of its course. If the left side is tensed, the arrow will fall short, and traction will be poor. If the belly is relaxed [and allowed to protrude], hernia (*infitág*) can result. If the waist is tensed, there will be loss of range, the chest will protrude, and the string catch the archer’s beard. The heart must be calm, for if it is preoccupied with anything but shooting, the whole operation will be labour in vain.
