COMMENT

332 Arrows may be divided into two basic types: (a) the long arrow (sahm sawil, or collectively, nushshdb), measuring about 30 in. in length and designed for use with the hand bow, and (b) the short arrow (sahm gasir). Originally intended to be shot from the normal hand bow by means of an arrow-guide (majrá, mijrdt, on which see Ch. 26), the ‘short arrow’ amounted to what we should in fact call a dart. A term frequently applied by our author to darts is nab?  (sing. nablak), a word which he regularly uses also in the sense of ‘crossbow bolts’. Measuring about 16 in. or less, both darts and bolts were of a number of different kinds and appear to have been named according to the salient features of their design or performance, etc.


1. Long Arrows

333 (a) Yaghlig, or harbi. This was the war arrow, the head of which was virtually a spike of square or triangular cross-section. This design was the most effective for the penetration of armour and mail, Although well made, it would have been a mass-produced article manufactured to a standard specification, unless specially ordered for persons of importance. Before an engage- ment the ordinary archer would have been equipped with a quiverful of selected arrows most suited to his needs, but, his quiver once emptied, he would have had to accept whatever the supply-train or arsenal had to offer.

(b) Maydani. As the name implies, this was an arrow designed for use in the mayddn, or training-ground, in which the archer practised, competed, and, on high days and holidays, dis- played his accuracy and skill before the ruler or the highest officers of state, or both. Whether the term mayddni was applied to more than one kind of practice arrow, it is difficult to say. It certainly applied to the target arrow (salu al-hadaf). One of the archer's prized possessions would have been a carefully matched set of target arrows of the finest craftsmanship fashioned from the best available materials and identical one with the other in weight and point of balance.  Though basically of the same weight and balance as the war arrow, the target arrow would have had a length and weight that had been carefully adjusted to suit the archer and the bow he used.  - The head was round in cross-section and pointed either as an ogive or a cone. An important and interesting reference to mayddnis is to be found in D, where we are told that ‘they should be hewn from well-proportioned billets of uniform length, thickness, and weight. Each of the batch should then be equilibrated one by one after the manner of the beam of a balance to establish the centre of gravity. This done, a mark should be made to indicate the point at which the

‘top and bottom are brought into harmony one with the other. Whenever the marks are found to ‘coincide in a number of arrows, they should be made into a set for a round (#adab), At the shorter of their two ends they should be fitted with well-proportioned heads of the same weight and quality, The fletchings should also match.’ (Dt, 20a; D*, 49b.). -

335(c) Amaji. This was a type of mayddani with a blunt head which was used by the mounted archer for shooting at marks placed on the ground (Ch. 15). They doubtless took hard treatment, and for this reason are likely to have been more roughly made than the target arrow. Limited

into butts of earth or sand would be assured by a blunt head (n. 10 above), which would not be liable to damage in the same way as a pointed head; ~

336(d) Sabgi. This was the flight arrow which was used when competing for distance regardless of accuracy. It was essential to have it as light and as strong as it was humanly possible to make it.  The wood of the shaft would be carefully selected and, though thinned to the highest degree, it had yet to be sufficiently strong and stiff to withstand the impact of the string when shot. There is reason to suppose that both long and short arrows were used for this purpose. (Ch. 19.)

The technique of flight shooting, which is different from that of precision shooting, was brought to a very high degree of perfection by the Ottoman Turks whose arrow design has never yet been surpassed. (For details, see F. Isles, SAA, vol. 4, 1961, pp. 25-28.) -

337(e) Haydari. In our view the term is suspect; it seems very probable that we should read janwart ‘animal, for usc against animals’, i.c. a hunting head. (See Glossary, s.v. haydari.)


2. Short Arrows

338 (a) Darts. References to these devices are frequent in Arab works on archery, Although they would appear to have lacked the weight to penetrate armour or mail, we can at least be sure that they were effective as a harassing device, especially against unprotected horses of enemy cavairy.  Practical trials show that they are projected at a high velocity with a low trajectory. This factor makes for accuracy, and at short range they would certainly have been most unpleasant to face.  At long range it would have been possible for massed archers to put down a barrage of such missiles as far as about 400 yards.

MSS of the CD groups offer some information on darts. The following details have been extracted from them (some versions are more accurate and/or informative than others):

339 No arrow for use with a guide should be longer than 2 spans (shibrs) and a digital phalanx ('ugdah; in all, about 16 in.). The war variety, that is, the Ausbdn (*hailstones"), should measure 2 spans, while the düdZni should, with the head, be 1j spans. The smaliest arrow for use with a guide should measure no less than } span (about 2} in.). Into this category fail the types jardd (‘locusts’), the length of which ranges from 1 span to $ span; and the 'usfuri (‘sparrow-like, bird-like"). For best results the short arrow should be half the length of the long, or, in other words, 2 spans. (C!, 32b; C*, 55a; C, 25a; D, 23a; D*, 52b.): From this last sentence it would seem that the long arrow was 4 spans long. As it measured 30 in. (above, p. 27), the span would be about 7} in. Further information on darts may be obtained from Cahen, BEO, XII, PP. 132-33, and Arab Archery, pp. 124-31, etc.  . .(b) Gressbow bolts. MSS of the CD groups again supply some information. The relevant portions follow closely upon those concerned with darts (see references immediately above, section 2 (a), and our observations on the versions). The specifications that are given relate to ‘bolts for use with particular crossbows the detailed construction of which is not known to us.  Those mentioned are (a) the 'aggar, ‘murderer’, which, if the definitions of Cahen (BEO, XII, 152, n. 10) and Huuri (Gesch, p. 120) are valid for the context, was a crossbow drawn by placing the feet on its limbs, and (b) the rikdé ‘stirrup’, which, as its name indicates, was the stirrup bow mentioned above (p. 19) as gatos ar-rikáb. The details may be summarized as follows:


3o SARACEN ARCHERY

340 Crossbow bolts (nabl gatos ar-rijT) should be the length of the distance from the (fore?) end of the grooved guide (majrá) along the top of the stock to the nut. (The length would have been in the order of 12 in.) For shooting at short ranges they should be 2 fingers shorter, In the case of the ‘aggdr the (head of?) the shaft should be level with the breast of the stock (sadr al-gadib; i.e. presumably, the front end) for precision shooting and opposite the pin

(mistnar) for distance. For shooting at short range a bolt should have a socketed head (baziak) .  of iron weighing 3 dirhams (142-8 gr.) with a shaft (sam) of 6 dirhams (285-6 gr.). This is the right size for the rikab. For the ‘aggar, on the other hand, the weight of the bolt head should

341be 31 dirhams (166-6 gr.) and the shaft (khashab) 7 dirhams (33272 gr.). In D*, 532, it is held that an arrowhead with a tang driven into the shaft with glue and bound with sinews is stronger and more effective than a socketed head (which is always liable on impact to break the shaft at the shoulder of the socket) and will admit of great accuracy. (Cf. D+, 23b-242.)


3. The Spinning Test

342 Both ancient and modern archers have used this method to determine the straightness of a shaft. It is simple and effective and, to master, needs very little practice. The thumb-nail is placed together with a finger-nail to form a shallow ‘V’ ia which to cradle the arrow close to its centre of gravity. The shaft is then spun with the other hand, If true, it will spin smoothly, whereas if it is in any way distorted, it will rattle between the nails.

The technique described here is termed idrar by Ibn Sidah who says that, when spun, the arrow should produce a lowing or whining sound that can only come from a straight and correctly shaped shaft of sturdy wood (Mukhassas, VI, 52). Perhaps a ‘hissing sound’ would be a more accurate description.

343 4. Weight of Long Arrows In our text nothing is said about this very important topic, but some information is offered in the CD MSS. We summarize here some of the weights supposedly specified by the ever-quoted Tahir al-Balkhi (C1, 292-b. Cf. C*, soa—b; C3, 21b-22a; D4, 21a; D°, so0a—b. See also Arad Archery, pp. 113-16, 174). The ranges given obviously refer to effective target ranges and not to maximum ranges. (In the first column the weights are those of the Baghdad standard, on which see Appendix 1.)

345 Specifications of arrow weights presented in a more detailed manner are to be found in the uNihayah and have been investigated by us (Latham and Paterson, JSS, X, 1965, pp. 253-61).  . {Since no figures are given for bow weights, however, they cannot be compared with the above.  ‘The lightest possible arrow is given as 304 gr. and the heaviest as 600 gr., the first for use with the lightest bow, and the second for use with the heaviest.


5. Arrowheads

346 ; —ÉU M — a TE” - information has been obtained. On the results of these trials the reader would do well to consult Archery (Badminton), Ch. xxiv, S. Pope, Hunting with the Bow and Arrow, pp. 46-49, and E. G.  Heath, JSAA, vol. 4, p. 18 (on the bodkin head).

The tapered spike, or bodkin, head gives the best penetration of armour or mail, and this was -the type used so effectively by the old English archers against armoured cavalry. The weakest part of this, or indeed any, arrowhead was the tip, for, if too fine, it could bend or snap on impact with armour and fail to penetrate. To a large extent, however, this hazard could— given correctly tempered steel and a reasonably square hit;—be overcome by slight blunting of the tip. When shot by strong and skilful archers, arrows fitted with such heads were capable of an astonishing degree of penetration, and actual examples can be found in abundance in Hansard's Book of Archery where we read, for instance, of an arrowhead so effective that it not only trans- fixed the protected leg of a horseman in armour, but even penetrated his saddle and went on to deal a mortal blow to his horse (p. 200).

347The broadhead is of little use against armour, but is most effective for hunting, for which purpose it was designed.

Two unusual shapes are mentioned in the text, namely, the olive and the chisel. Although it is doubtful whether the penetrative qualities of the former would be equal to those of the bodkin, the latter would overcome any possible weakness liable to arise from a finer point and would be fully effective against armour.

348 6. Feathers


In English practice a feather is described as right-handed or left-handed according to the.  results obtained by viewing the top surface from the base of the quill when held towards the person. If the web of the feather runs to the right from the quill, it is right-handed, and vice versa.

349When a fletching is prepared, part of the quill is left on the base of the web. If this is not

done, or if too much of the quill is cut away, the feather loses much of its natural stiffness and, accordingly, its quality. We are in complete agreement with the author that all fletchings on an arrow must be of the same hand and that the centre part of the feather is superior to either of the two ends. There are no valid grounds for preferring right-handed or left-handed feathers.

350English fletchers have always favoured wing-pinions for strength. The difficulty presented by their natural curve (below) could be overcome quite simply by placing the prepared fletching in a hot, damp cloth for a minute or two before affixing it to the shaftment as this temporarily softened the quill and allowed it to be fastened in alignment with the axis of the shaft. Tail-feathers, though not as tough and strong as wing-pinions, are straight and therefore easier to handle. The tail- feathers of both the vulture and eagle, however, have for all practical purposes no weakness so far as the archer is concerned and, furthermore, they are stronger than goose pinions which were those most widely used in the West.

The web of a feather has a natural cutve, and even when a straightened quill i is fastened i in alignment with the axis of the shaft, the arrow will spin in flight. It is for this reason that the feathers on an arrow must be of the same hand, for, if of different hands, they will result in

351 32 | SARACEN ARCHERY


unsteady flight and excessive drag. With a broadhead it is generally accepted that a higher rate.  of spin is needed to counteract the effect of a side wind on the blade, and in this case the quill is set slightly out of true to increase the spin in the natural direction given by the feathers. Archers still debate not only the merits or otherwise of using such spiralled fletchings for all arrows, but also the question whether four fletchings should be used as opposed to three. It is not the place here to enter into their unending controversies on these points.

352The shapes into which feathers have been trimmed after being set to the shaftment have varied widely over the centuries and in different areas. All the illustrations and miniatures in the numerous MSS which we have so far examined for the period which immedistely concerns us show them cut to a low arc of a circle. As observed in note 19, the two names applied by our author to one type of fletching are uncertain. In A we find makyi and aktaf. The first of these terms (for which in B, er al. we have the apparently meaningless makbiif) means ‘measured’ or ‘a measure’, while the second means ‘shoulder-blades’. For the latter the reading of B*, b$, and 5 is akuff ‘pans of a balance’, which, so far as we can judge, could only mean that the fletching was trimmed to a contour similar to that of the rim of a balance pan. Such a line would correspond to the design seen in miniatures. It is possible, however, that we should read akzaf (second vowel short) with the meaning ‘broad-shouldered’, which, from a grammatical standpoint, would make better sense. It is also just possible that we should take makedl in a sense similar to that of - mukattal ‘round and compact’, ‘stout and short’, or the like.

FrG, 16. PARTS OF A FEATHER AND FLETCHED SHAFT VIEWED FROM Nock To English archers the feathers on thc shaft are right-handed (p.26)

355 The term ‘gazelle’ (ghizlan, sing. ghazal) docs not suggest any particular shape. It is interesting to note, however, that our author recommends that the rear ends of the feather be left like the tips of a swallow’s wings, thus following the natural line of the rachis. This cor:esponds to the martin trim mentioned in Arab Archery, p. 113, and it may well be that to some the appearance would be evocative of a fleeing gazelle.

The Maghrebi writer’s view that right-handed feathers should be used when the wind comes in from the left, and vice versa, should be disregarded. ‘There is in fact no different in performance between left-handed and right-handed feathers either as regards direction of flight or behaviour in a crosswind. On this point we are supported by Dr. P. iia icles assistance we gratefully Sada d

356 7. The Size of the Nock


Taybugha’ s recommendation that the nock should be one-third the circumference of the string is basically sound. Applicable to long and short arrows alike, this rule would give a good fit, In D there is the following observation: ‘A long nock gives.a more accurate and stable arrow than a short one, though the latter gives: greater speed. The most appropriate lengths for a nock

357 ON ARROWS 33


ate those which will take the width of two bowstrings, or the fletchings from their highest point or the arrowhead from the point where the tempering ends. The converse is true in the case of flight arrows." (D+, 202; D*, 49b.)

358That the depth of the nock for the normal long arrow should be equal to twice the thickness of the string is reasonable. If the converse is true in the case of flight arrows, this may be taken to mean that the flight nock should only equal one thickness. The point about the fletchings and.  tempering would appear to be that both the height of the feathers (i.e. their breadth from the quill) at their farthest. from the shaft and the length of the tempered tip of the arrowhead should measure the thickness of two bowstrings. They could, therefore, be used as a gauge.

In 5, 13a-b, the interesting view is expressed that in the case of the flight arrow the depth of the nock should be one-third of the thread (used to measure the circumference of the string), in the case of the maydani one-half, and in the case of the giga/, or gighaj (see Glossary and Ch. 15) two-thirds.

359 8. Lengths of Arrows


The only right way to determine the correct length of an arrow for any given archerds for that archer himself to come to the positisn of full draw and then measure. Other methods can only give an apptoximate result, and some degree of error is almost inevitable. For target shooting, the archer, then as now, would almost certainly have had his own set of arrows made to measure, but in combat, as already stated, he would have had to accept a standard length supplied by the arsenal. It is logical to suppose that such arrows would have been made for archers with the longest draw; for too long an arrow would be safer than one that was short, the reason being that in the heat of action there would be a danger of the archer's overdrawing a short arrow and bringing the head inside the bow. With luck the arrow would merely glance off the wrong side of the bow and be wasted. The real hazard, however, would be that he could put the arrow through his own hand, or, if the head of the arrow was to hit the inside of the grip, the shaft would break, the rear
