# 27 - On the procedures, conduct, and principles to be observed by a novice

[Mark and carefully retain the fundamentals as expounded in our work, for practice will prove then to be sound. If you are wise, you will practise patiently and persistently, for anything hard can become easy with practice. Furthermore, before you uy for marksmanship and take up wagering, aspire to mastery of the draw and accuracy in range and elevation.] This advice is intended to encourage the novice (*tālib*), firstly, to apply himself to learning, secondly, to acquire a thorough grasp of the fundamentals of archery and the technique of perfect shooting by dint of hard and regular practice, and thirdly, to aspire to mastery of the draw until it is so impressed upon his limbs that he will infringe none of the fundamental rules when shooting. All this can only be attained by patience, perseverance, and much regular practice, which must be acquired before he tries for marksmanship and wagering; for if the novice is bent on shooting a marksman arrow he will fail to notice that he is unconsciously infringing the fundamental rules of his art.

The first thing that a learner should do is to take a light bow of the kind termed *kabbād*, grasp it, and draw with the three appropriate fingers for some days until he can apply the correct grasp. He should next lock his fingers on the bowstring without using an arrow and draw for a time until he is able to lock correctly and can thus grasp, lock, and draw to the best of his physical ability. When he has succeeded in this, he should, for some days, nock an arrow and bring it to full draw without shooting. He should then lock on the string without an arrow and loose an uncharged string, practising this for a time until he can release correctly. In his next stage he should nock what is known as a *jarrām*, [or unfletched arrow], and draw and release it at a practice drum (*battiyyah*). He should do this for quite a time, and, once able to shoot correctly, progress to a bow a little more powerful than the one he has been shooting and again shoot at the practice drum for some days. Every few days he should take a more powerful bow until he has worked through five successive bows, each stronger than the one before, and the fifth most powerful of all.

Once he has acquired control and developed a natural proficiency in shooting, he should begin to bend powerful bows that are as strong as he can possibly handle and continue shooting at the practice drum night and day with different bows. When he can shoot correctly and his limbs are steady and firm, ‘he can then go out into the field and shoot at the butt for some days without using any mark, all the tíme watching where his arrows fall. Once he can do correctly all that he has set out to do, he should next go out into the desert and shoot into the great void, again without any mark, all the time watching the flight of his arrows through the air. When he can see that his arrows do not flirt, but pass properly through the air in even flight, he should, after mastering all this, shoot at a mark on his own and persevere until he attains a high proportion of accurate shots.

During all this training he should go and consult master archers and show them how he shoots, asking them to point out his faults and how to eliminate them. He should regularly watch how first-class bowmen shoot without taking part himself and endeavour to assimilate good points either from what he himself can see to be good performance or from their own conversation.  These he should put into practice on his own, and when he has acquired mastery and considers his shooting to be as perfect as that of other archers, and when this view is confirmed by what full-fledged archers [who have seen his shooting] have to say about him, he may join them. In his conversation with such persons he should be polite and gracious, adopting an attitude of self-abasement and humility, and should shoot with them as they deem appropriate until he becomes conversant with their customs and drill. During this time, furthermore, he should seek useful advice from persons he considers qualified to give it. When he outclasses someone else, he should not exalt himself above that person nor despise him nor provoke him, but rather make modesty his rule and observe silence and good manners. Finally, hard and regular practice is as a religious bounden duty to be performed by every archer whether he be a teacher (*mu' allim*) or learner (*muta' allim*).

It is established in authentic tradition that the Prophet said, ‘The angels attend no human sport save archery.’ Archers should therefore be aware of the exalted station of the angels who attend them and should rank them as guests and respect them, for the Prophet said, ‘If a man believe in God and the Last Day, let him do honour to his guest.’ Going to the shooting range (*marmā*), then, should be regarded by the archer as going to the mosque, and he should consider those with whom he consorts there as leaders of men and persons of the highest standing. Likewise, he should think of his training in archery as training in religious knowledge. He should therefore make a practice of first performing a lesser ablution and set about his business, praising God with tongue and heart as he makes for one of the gardens of Paradise with the peace of God upon him and with dignity of bearing. When he reaches his destination (i.e. the range), he should enter politely, greeting all those present with the words, ‘Peace be upon you!’  He would do well also to perform two *rak‘ahs* in an act of worship. It is not a matter of saluting the actual place, but rather a key to safe-keeping, success, and accurate shooting; for if proceedings are opened with an act of worship, they will be worthy of a happy issue and will be blessed with God’s good direction and success. The archer should next say a private prayer and ask God - exalted be He - for good direction and right guidance, for it is an established tradition that the Prophet said, ‘'Ali, ask God for guidance and good direction, and, in asking for guidance, remember to ask that you be guided in the right path, and, in asking for good direction, remember to ask that the arrow be well directed to the mark.’

The next step is for the archer to take out his bow and arrows, examine them, and see what choice shooting demands. Tightening his belt, he then prepares himself for shooting, and, when his turn comes round, rises, tucks up his sleeve if it is too ample, and gathers his skirt into his belt if it is hanging down and utters the invocation, 'In the name of God'. He then takes his arrows in his right hand and his bow in his left and stations himself in his proper place in a polite, calm, and dignified manner, at the same time lowering his eyes in modest silence, moving gracefully and easily, and praying God to grant him power, might, and accuracy. He next places his arrows in his waist-belt, takes out the first arrow, examines it, spins it on the nail of the middle finger in between the ends of the left index finger and thumb, nocks it gracefully without looking at the operation, and then shoots in the manner already described, When the arrow leaves the centre of the bow; he should follow it with his eyes to the point of descent and, if it hits the mark, praise God and show Him gratitude. If he misses, he should reflect on the reason for his failure and earnestly try to eradicate the fault which caused him to miss.

Every time the archer shoots he should invoke God - exalted be He - with the words, ‘In the name of God’ and, whenever he makes a hit, he should praise Him to whom belongs all power and glory. He should regard accurate shooting as proceeding from the bounty of God - exalted be He - and the divine guidance and assistance. If he misses, he should not become exasperated or despair of God’s refreshing justice, nor should he revile himself or his bow or his arrows. To do with cries of ‘Well done!’ ‘And by God,’ said he, ‘they had no sooner applauded than I blushed for shame at such-and-such a mistake I had once made in the same matter!’

Do beware of impairing your own ability by seeing another hit the mark when you yourself have failed to make the same grade, for there is no question bere of any deficiency. No, deficiency, all deficiency in fact, is a matter of being incapable of aspiring to reach the highest level and attain your objective. Do not tell yourself, therefore, that you cannot attain what others have achieved, for anyone who says this betrays the fact that he is a failure who cannot succeed and has lost all ambition. It is upon aspirations that men depend for achievement. In the two collections of authentic traditions of the Prophet it is reported that he said, ‘The believer who is strong is better in the sight of God and dearer to Him than the believer who is weak.’ In every righteous enterprise, therefore, strive after that which will avail you, ask God for succour, and do not flag. On this very Point one poet says:

> ‘If the qualities of a man arouse your admiration, then be him,
>And you yourself will soon display those same qualities that you admire in him.
>To generous and noble deeds there is none to bar your way, if only you approach them."

Another poet says:

> ‘It (defeat) surely must not cause you to despair.
> Of preparing for another fight, for glory comes by stages and degrees;
> The spear’s cane shaft whose height you have beheld grows slowly, climbing joint by joint.’

While shooting is taking place, the archer should not lok too much at his companion nor disturb him not distract him with anything such as conversation or the like. Neither should he reproach him for his mistakes no laugh at him, for if a man abuses a brother  uslim for some mishap, the same will be visited upon himself. There is indeed a plain and authe tic tradition that the prophet said, ‘Do not abuse your brother, for God will deliver him and visit you yourself with affliction.’ The archer, and indeed any other Muslim and believer, must concern himseif only with his own faults, Praise God, then, and do not grudge your brother archer his successful shooting nor make his achievement seem paltry in his eyes. You should not say, ‘A good shot for one who is no archer!’ nor again, 'A lucky shot!' This kind of behaviour is that of low and ignorant people who know nothing of life and have no practical experience of men and affairs.

An archer's next step in his training must be to familiarise himself with the faults that bowmen experience in hte matter of aim, hands and arms, alignment, loosing and locking, and to aquire a knowledge of defects in bows and arrows and an ability to distinguish good from bad. He should know how to heat a bow and how to adjust and repair it, how to straighten his arrows and correct the curve of his bow, and how to knot his bowstrings. He should also know how to eradicate a fault if one occurs and know the reason for the fault. When he has a knowledge, mastery, and understanding of such matters as well as skill and proficiency in shooting, and then, acquiring familiarity with the rules of wagering and legitimate shooting, is able to distinguish between what is permissible and what is not, is familiar with competition shooting and the rules and regulations for other archery contests - when, I say, he has a knowledge, mastery, and understanding of such matters, a man is then a full-fledged archer and can take his place as such among his fellows and share their fortunes and misfortunes. But even so, he will still not have a complete grasp of all there is to know about shooting, and he will never be too old to learn.  Authorities on archery say that, no matter how much knowledge of the art of shooting a man may acquire and no matter how long he lives, he will not achieve complete mastery.
