# Notes and references

## MANUSCRIPTS (Move to beginning?)

In the introduction we have described the British Museum codex on which this
work is based and, in general terms, defined and discussed the various groups of
MSS used to control, correct, or otherwise improve the text and add to our
knowledge of its subject matter. Restricting ourselves to bare essentials, we
now give particulars about individual MSS, the groups into which we have placed
them, and the meaning of the symbols by which we refer to them.  Further
information about them can be found ín sources indicated in parentheses
following the indication of date, and, in the case of the Istanbul MSS, the
reader should consult Ritter, Zs/., XVIII, 1929, pp. 137 ff.

1324Before proceeding to details we draw special attention to the following point:
in the case of groups A, C, and D, the unqualified usc of the letter assigned to
the group indicates that it denotes all MSS within thar group. Its meaning in
the case of the B group will be explaincd when we come to it.


A Al: British Museum, Add, 23489. No date, but probably early fifteenth century,
if not end of fourteenth, (Catalogus codicum manuscriptorum orientalium
. . . Pars secunda..., Londini, 1846 (-1871), pp. 667-68. Fox descriptions,

1325
etc., see also above, pp. xxxv-vi.)

At: Cambridge University Library. MS Qq.240 (7). Date: 886/1481. (E. G. Browne,
A Hand-List of the Muhammadan Manuscripts, etc., Cambridge, 1900, p. 127.) This
is a badly written and defective copy, apparently transcribed from the same
source as At and frequently more word-perfect, but containing more or less the
same lacunae as their common source. It becomes very defective towards the end.

1326
a o: Istanbul, Aya Sofya, 2902 mük, [=i]. Date: 802/1400, (Ritter, op. Cit.,
p. 139. See also above, p. xxxvii.)  B To save space we quote only the two main
representatives of this group (see B, below) unless there is complete unanimity
in all MSS or unless there is some special reason for doing otherwise
(e.g. because B! is at variance with B7). It should be noted that, unlike A, C,
and D, B does not denote all MSS of the group, This is either so termed er,
where appropriate, indicated by Bb. The following expedients are adopted:


B denotes B'B* b s bibib?b! (abbr. b!)

1327
Bt: Istanbul, Aya Sofya, 4193. Date: 795/1393. (Ritter, op. cit., p. 138.)
Described as a commentary on the poem Ghunyat al-Murámi, it is attributed to a
Shaykh Ibn Abi Hajalah. It may well be that this is the name of the


person who corrected and revised Taybugha’s text.  B: Paris, Bibliotheque
Nationale, Arabe 6,160, Date: 799/1397. (G. Vajda, Index général des manuscrits
arabes, etc., Paris, 1953. P- $77.) Not, in general, as accurate as B!, There
are two paginations; that executed in

1328
occidental numerals is followed.  bt: Istanbul, Aya Sofya, 4320. Date:
864/1459-60. (Ritter, op. cit., p. 138.) Our microfilm copy which comes to an


abrupt end at folio 6oa is apparently incomplete, but on this point we can
supply no further information, b:: Istanbul, Aya Sofya, 3800. No date, but
probably fifteenth century. (Ritter, op. cit., p. 137.)  b*: Cambridge
University Library, MS Qa. 173(8). Date: 1174/1759-$0. (Browne, op. cic,
p. 127.) Has close

1329
affinities with b’.  bt: Istanbul, Aya Sofya, 4198 (from folio 89b). Date:
873/1469. (Ritter, op. cit, p. 138.) Close affinities with Bê,


b b: Leiden, Bibliotheek der Riiksuniversiteit, Cod. Or. 74. No date, but
probably post-sixteenth century. (Catalogus Codicum Orientalium, etc,, III,
Lugd.-Bat., 1865.)  C C!: Istanbul, Topkapı Sarayı Müzesi Kütüphanesi,
HI. Ahmet: 2603. Date: 805/1493, (Ritter, op. cit., p. 139, under Seraib. 2608.)

cannot be discussed here.

13361. For the Muslim, archery, like all human activity, must be motivated by
religion. Hence, in order to serve the ends of his Islamic conscience a
religious case is shaped in support of word and deed. Material similar to, and
in some cases identical with, that presented by our author is to be found in
other treatises, Cf., for example, Arab A PP. 3-9, 24-25; Hein, Isl, XIV, 1925,
pp. 294, 300, 303, 312-13, 317, 319-29. Cf. Klopsteg, pp. 12-13 I14-16.

2. We omit severa! lines of unimportant subject matter. At this point in A? a
lacuna begins, which ends only at what in A‘ is v. 23 of the poem.

are not expressly stated, but implied in the verse with which the commentary is
opened in our text. As in A'a, the opening is abrupt. In all other MSS the
commentary is more smoothly introduced with subject matter of a little more
genera! nature.

2. Conjectural translation of ragàt (‘layers, strands") whose meaning in this
context is not entirely clear. It may mean the laminated section of the bow
which lies betwecn the two siyahs, consisting of the two dustdrs (see Glossary)
and the grip.

13403. Cf. Arab Archery, p. 13,

4. Sec ibid., p. 83, n. 35. Faris and Elmer take the significance of ‘power’
(questeah) and ‘strength’ (shiddah) to be,

1341respectively, length of cast and force of impact, but from Taybugha’s
introduction (p. 3) it would scem that if

there is in fact any difference in meaning, it is that quwwah relates to the
potential of the bow proper and shiddak to that of the bowstring. If this is the
case, he is not always consistent in his use of the terms.  . According to CD
(e.g. C?, 38a; D4, 45b), gluing and binding were winter processes, reflexing
being carried out in the spring. Climatic differences probably account for the
discrepancy.  . Cf. CD.  B. ‘ The flight bow, being more delicate than the war
bow, needs special care when flexed for bracing. Both limbs must be bent equally
and together. This point is not mentioned in Ch. 17 (on bracing).  Some
information on Oriental crossbows and arbalests may be derived from Reinaud, 74,
1848, pp. 211-18; E{uuri, Gesch., and Cahen, BEO, XII, pp. 129-34 and
pp. 151-54.

ro. According to D, the hand bow is preferable because it has the support of
Prophetic tradition, combines lightness with rapid shooting and effectiveness,
and is the weapon of kings. The crossbow, on the other hand, is simpler to use
and is more serviceable in fortresses and in ships, where it can stand up to the
damp salt air—presurnably if constructed as indicated in our text.

pp. 94-102.  1. The reading of a, supplying, in our view, a lacuna in A which in
the absence of this one word reads ‘it is called “the Persian” ", In other MSS
chillah is either spclied differently (e.g. B'bt*: jila} or has been corrupted.
2. From the text it is not clear whether glue was used in the Persian string. It
is certainly not mentioned, and in a there i$ no mention of glue in connexion
with either string. Cathayan string is there said to be ‘made of raw, wound silk
with a little wax’ (x72). This reading, however, is exceptional. Some form of
binding agent would certainly be needed, be it glue or wax, or, a5 in the case
of Ottoman and Sino-Tatar strings, thread or twine bound around the strands,
otherwise the string would become inextricably tangled when removed from the
bow.  3. ‘A thin string is better for the flight bow because it increases
cast... but it requires mastery of shooting, for unless the loose is clean, the
arrow will flirt and lose range’ (Klopsteg, p. 55. Cf. Hein, 4:3., XV, p. 3).
4. Reading yusadda (B) for yushadda (A*, 26b, line 6).  s. According to C, the
raps were held in a container of some kind or other and hung from the string by
a hook.  Before each extra ratí was added the hook and container were removed.

The A text is cleariy corrupt and should be restored by reference to a. ‘Arrow’
as a translation of sahm is here technically inappropriate.  The word can mean
‘stave’ and in this context it must denote what is nowadays termed the ‘prod’,
i.e, the stave or lathe which constitutes the actual bow as opposed to the stock
Camüd).  9. In B, et al., *oa-s-salm , . . al-roatr’ is not immediately followed
by a description of the method determining the lenath of the crossbow string,
which is deferred until the end of the chapter and is phrased somewhat
differently: ‘The way to determine the length of the string for a jarkh and
similar weapons is to ascertain first the length of the bow from nock to nock
. . . and then to fx twa pegs into a wall, putting a distance equivalent to five
times the length of the bow between the two. You next twist the resulting string
lengthwise in the appropriate manncr into four strands and knot the two loops at
each end,’ Cf. a, 18b.  ro. Reading asaddu (or, perhaps, ahdā) for asda (A},

making comparisons it

should be borne in mind that Mustafa Kani is primarily concerned with flight
shooting, in which requirements are different from those imposed by other kinds
of shooting. Useful information may also be derived from Arab Archery,
pp. 103-16 and index under ‘arrows’, ‘feathers’, etc.

clearty an adjective from haydar, onc meaning of which is ion’, It may therefore
designate a type of hunting head, in which case it may have been a broadhead,
which is most suitable for this purpose. As Taybugha is interested essentially
in military archery, it is understandable that he should dismiss such a head as
inferior. Jaydar, apart from being a proper name CAL, the son-in-law of the
Prophet, was so called) may mean: (a) short, smal! made; (b) hard. We should

is implied,

1355I2. According to CD, it is the tang, and not the head, to which Taybugha refers
here. Our text makes sound, clear Sense as it stands, however. What is meant is
that the complete head—which includes the tang—imust be cvenly balanced about
its longitudinal axis.

I5. D. Herea long head is recommended for armour-piercing purposes. It should
not, however, be too long as it wil!  then be weak, It is added that the shorter
the arrowhead, the more firmly it will sit in the arrow, especially if it has a
long tang.

135716. In CD there is a warning against allowing the head to absorb too much water
when tempering. Over-quenching

could in fact make the steel brittle.

1358The reading of A! (32a, line 6) is at-ta'álig ash-shVf (V2y. None of our MSS
offers a reading that is really

intelligible to us, We conjecture ta‘dlig (or, less probably, ta‘alif) a5-5uft

weight. This is too heavy for practical purposes,

1360I9. The reading of At, 32b, line 7, is al-makvül wa-huwa l-ak:äf. The reading of
5, 14b, viz. al-makildt wa-huwa Laktuff, suggests that we should read al-makyül
wa-huwa I-akuff, which is virtually what we find in B, 24a, The problem is
discussed in detail on p- 32.

is called the martin trim, because it is shaped like the wings of a martin,’

fletchings from the nock, the better tlie cast, whereas the nearer they are, the
truer the course,’

26, In CD it ís recommended that soft feathers be used for summer Shooting and
hatd ones for winter and damp conditions.

136427. Nibil, pl. of nabl. Elsewhere our author uses this word in the sense of
‘dart’ or ‘boit’, but here he is quoting a North African writer who probably
used a different vocabulary. It should also be noted that the feathers are here
named right-handed or left-handed according to the principle observed in
England, Quotation from a North African writer is no doubt responsible for
Taybughà's apparent self-contradiction.

28, In CD it is specified that in this case the feathers are those of the yasij
arrow (see Glossary).

136631. The author expresses himself badly in Arabic, but other MSS show that this
is the sense. In D a rule of thumb is given: "To form a rough idea of the
correct length of an arrow, the arrowhead may be put under the archer's
armpit. What he then does is to stretch out his arm along the arrow, and if the
middle finger reaches the end of the nock it is right for size."

some kind of crossbow so far as the present context is concerned. According to
Dozy, Suppl, II, 447, it was originally an ‘espèce de baliste, de catapulte,
destinée à lancer des pierres, le feu grégeois, ou d'autres projectiles’. The
name was later applied to some sort of firearm. See EY*, art. Bárüd, sect, iii.

sources make much of the fact that he was the first to strike a blow for
Islam. At some point in Islamic history, which we have not been able to
determine with any certainty, his name began to be associated with archery, and
he finally emerged as the ‘patron saint" of the craft (sec Hein, Fsh, XIV,

presumably also in Berlin 5539, for Hein calls him al-Fazari (/sl., XIV,
P. 300)—there can be no doubt that his name is as stated by us, since we are
specifically told in our MSS that it derives from the name of a place on the
marches of Khorasan in territory ‘contiguous with the land of the Turks’. The
place in question is undoubtedly Faravah, originally a frontier station (ribdt)
and now Kizil Arvat in Turkmenistan on the Transcaspian railway, In spelling the
name of the man ‘al-Qarawi’ and that of the place “Qarawah’, the scribe of the
Wadik, Ist., is only one diacritical point away from accuracy, Ar-Tabari speaks
of his mentor in glowing terms as an unrivalled master who instructed him in the
teachings of Tahir’s school, In the absence of precise dutes, we can say only
that he flourished at some period during the thirteenth century.  9. Whether
these form part of what al-Farawi said is not clear,

happen that the arrow gets stuck in the grip either because it is too short, or
because the bow has been overdrawn, the arrow will break upon release and injure
the archer. He should, therefore, in such an eventuality draw back even further
and either take the arrow between his teeth or push it away with his beard.’ (C,
51a; C3, 83a-b; C?, 425-433; cf. D, 38a, D?, 642—b); *Some archers, upon
loosing, retain the position of their hands and arms ín the same vertical and
horizontal planes as in the draw so that neither the left hand nor the right
moves outwards, upwards, or downwards, This loose is called the mustawi, Used by
the Chosroes and the Wasitis, it is said to give a more accurate arrow, Others
clench their fingers upon loosing in the same way as one would in
punching. Others again loose in this way, but open the index finger as soon as
the arrow leaves the bow. In both the hand should be held steady behind the
ear.’ (D', 38a-b; D^, 64a.)

commentary; sec Introduction) and A.H. 799 (1397), the year of our earliest

fact Viccroy of Tripoli, Azdamur may be a textual! corruption of Aydamur, who
ruled in that capacity about 1371-2 (Sobernheim, Matériaux, 2me partie,
pp. 118-19). The latter, however, is styled dateddar (‘Keeper of the Inkweli’),
not &haznadar (‘Treasurer’). The reading of a probably refers to a viceroy
appointed in A.H, 880 (1475-6) (ibid., pp. 57-58, 129-30), which, since it is
too late for our present purpose, is useful only for estimating the date of the

favour of some such meaning as is given in Dozy, Suppl., s.v.: ‘chambre haute,
chambre qui est en haut de la maison, du palais’. As regards the sentence as a
whole, the import is in no doubt. The archer is advised to select a high point
and to stand at such a distance from it that it is at 45° to his horizontal line
of sight. In this way he could be sure of his elevation,

enough to take the bowstring. At the stopped end is fitted a tassel of silk or
cord so that it can be held (between the middle finger?) and ring-finger. The
device is used as follows. You slip the julbak on to the bowstring, place the
nock in the julbah, lock. and shoot.”

notch, the razor inserted, and the tail of the shaft bound with sinew up to the
base of the noch, the nock would not be very much weakened.

16. In Bbb this section follows that dealing with arrow-guides (out Ch. 26),
which is placed immediately after that on nockless arrows. Both in content and
presentation the version contained in these MSS differs from ours.  Because of
textual corruption and certain differences in wording in the various MSS the
following rendering is based on a composite text:

1487
On Shooting Iron Pellets with a Hand Bow


For this purpose you usc a tube (juléak) of iron or copper big enough to take
the pellets. This tube should have a tang (silàz) like an arrowhead and be
mounted on an unfletched arrow. You drill a hole in the shaft near the place
where the fletchings are fitted (b: ‘below the nock’) into which you can insert
something to hold the arrow to the bowstring so that it will not fly when shot,
With another cord you attach the arrow to the grip, but not so tightly that it
will not allow the arrow free movement (5: ‘when drawn’). To shoot, you nock the
arrow, secure it to the string, put the pellet in the tube, lock, and shoot
without following through with any forward and downward movement of the left
arm. This technique is of great value in battles and sieges because the archer
can heat the iron pellets in the fire and shoot them to ignite anything he may
choose, such as bales of cotton used to barricade points that have been breached
by a mangoncl, and so on. It can also be used for shooting birds and other
creatures with clay pellets. If small pellets are used, they can be employed to
wound beasts of burden and unprotected men . . . For the purpose of shooting
pellets, an arrow-guide has been designed after the style of the king-guide,
complete with a cylindrical cjector (midfa* mudawwar) which is fitted on to the
string, The pellets are then inserted and shot. Iron pellets heated to a glow
and shot into the midst of troops is a specta- cular stratagem in battle, The
technique can be used for business or pleasure. You can also use a tube big
enough to take a hen’s egg, which you can then shoot. This is a cunning stunt,
If you like, you can drain the egg, fill it with resin, and launch it at your
enemy. It is a very useful means of firing ships and the like. You can also fill
the egg with quick-lime and shoot it into the enemy’s face, or else you can pack
it with resin or some resin compound or pitch, and so on. Special crossbow
arrows can also be used for the same purpose...”

148817. Reading Ahurribat (a) for the meaningless jurribat (A!, 1022, line 7).

18. The idea seems to be that the end by which this device was fitted to the
shaft formed a tight-fitting tubular socket,

148919. Reading füg for farq (åt, to2b, line 3).

20. Bowstrings are often bound at the nocking-point to withstand the chafe of
the nock. There is no mention of such a practice in our treatise, but this docs
not exclude the possibility of its existence, Whether the leather band referred
to was fitted only to strings intended for use with a guide of the type
described, we cannot say,

archery (Ch. 14 and 15). In its original position it probably followed the
section on flight shooting (Ch. r9), as it does in Bbb, Its place in our
sequence has been determined by our inference that it was originally intended as
a conclusion (see next note), Its connexion with Ch. 28 is close, and a natural
scquence is broken if the two are separated. The connexion is recognized in Bbé
in which no break in sequence occurs,

2. There is a lacuna in A, which should be supplied on the indication of aBbé by

Muslim (d. 875)—or in the works of other important compilers, such as an-Nasii'i

1498IS. A rak'ah is a devotional exercise in Muslim ritual prayer, consisting of

consists of a fixed number of rak'ahs.
