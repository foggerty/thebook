# 17 - On bracing the bow (*itar al-qaws*)

Some masters in the art of shooting maintain that bracing the bow is a fundamental, while others consider it a secondary basis of archery. The former hold that any archer who is not proficient in bracing is incompetent, and in their eyes he is not a complete archer.

A bow may be braced in quite a number of ways, but here we shall confine our attention to the most useful.

The following procedure is a military technique. Grasp the grip of your bow with your left hand in such a way that you have the back, as opposed to the belly, which will be the side nearer to the string [when the bow is braced], facing you. You put the nock under the fourth toe of your left foot to prevent the loop of the string from slipping out when the bow is flexed (*inda n-naz’*) for bracing. The fourth toe and little toe must then be wrapped over the loop and tensed. At this point a very good tip must be noted: the archer can always secure the loop of his string to the nock [of the lower siyah] with a piece of thread to keep it from slipping out when bracing.  Your next step is to plant your right leg in an upright supporting position (between the bow and its string). This done, quickly and firmly set the belly of the arm (*yad*) of your bow - in other words, its longer half (*sic*), or upper limb, which is termed the ‘shooting limb’ (*bayt ar-ramy*) and which is the section between the siyah and the grip - on to your right knee at a point close to the grip with the string resting on your calf. Now apply pressure to the bow with the palm of your right hand, holding the loop of the string in the ends of your fingers. The way to do this is first to grasp the grip of the bow with your left hand and the lower part of the upper siyah and the string with the right, the knot of the loop being heid in position between the right index finger and middle finger. You then grasp the middle of the sides of the loop with the ends of the index finger and thumb and apply pressure to the bow with the front of the right palm as you tense the right knee and left leg, at the same time pulling the left hand and grip towards you and pushing with the heel of the right hand until the loop slips into the nock in the siyah. Keep hold of the upper siyah and the loop of the bowstring to guard against the danger of the siyah’s springing round into its unbraced position (*inqilāb*), for if one is in too much of a hurry to take his hand off the neck of a bow, it may, if too flexible or in any way twisted, spring round and perhaps break, doing harm, in any event, to the archer. Once the loop has been slipped into the nock in the *siyah*, the whole hand should be used to maintain a tight hold on them both until it is quite certain that they are properly in place and that the siyah has settled. Then the archer - whose hand ought never at any stage to have left the grip - should turn the bow with both hands, take the *siyah* of the lower limb in his right with the string towards his face, and examine the bow.  Should he find it to be out of true or twisted, he should correct it.

Once the bow is braced, the necks should be adjusted and pressure applied to the stronger limb until the archer thinks the bow is as it should be. Then, [grasping the bow with his left hand, as previously described, he should take the centre of the string in all fingers of his right, and, if the bow is stable and not very much older than the string, draw it. If, on the other hand, the bow is much older than the stríng, or is twisted, or displays some characteristic that will be detrimental to it [when drawn], he should leave it to settle to the string and later test it by drawing gently to see whether the necks have settled and whether the string is right for its draw-weight or not. All tests of this kind, of course, are applicable only if the archer finds the bow to be true. Should he detect some twist in it, on the other hand, he should draw it only after adjusting it and leaving it for a while to settle. If the twist is quite marked, he should defer bracing until he has heated his bow on all sides over a gentle flame with the application of rather more heat to the concave surface (*batn*) of the distortion and the belly (*wajh*) of the bow.  It should then be gently and lightly pressed into shape in a former (*qālah*). To do this calls for dexterity, deftness, and technical skill, and great care must be taken to ensure that the bow neither springs round nor gets burned. How to correct a bow in this way is something every archer should know very well and be determined to master; for it is a great fundamental and an accomplishment that none can aiford to ignore since a bow is prone to distortion and must be constantly watched. Care of this kind will keep a bow in condition and prolong its life. Sound shooting cannot be achieved with a bow that is not itself sound. Any archer, therefore, who cannot brace his bow properly and correct any irregular curves it may develop is incompetent, contemptible, unenterprising, and wholly unworthy of the name of archer.

## Bracing on horseback

To brace a bow on horseback while charging [or wheeling], grasp your bow as described in the preceding section, but bring it in against the horse’s neck. More precisely, set the neck of the lower limb against the base of the animal’s neck at the juncture of its neck and chest. The rest of the procedure is as already indicated in the last section.

619If you wish to try a different method, lodge the neck of your bow quickly but securely in the instep of the right foot with the string in place and the grip pressed firmly against the outside of the right knee. Next bring your right hand to bear on the neck of the bow, that is to say, the base of the *siyah* and, with your left, draw the string up until you can slip it into the nock.

In other words, you put the lower *siyah* of the bow under the sole of your right foot, hold the upper styah with your right hand and the string with your left, and complete the operation in the manner described. If you wish to brace on the left side, the method is the same (*mutatis mutandis*).

By another method you can use your right hand to take hold of the neck to which the string has been fixed and hold the loop between your teeth.

## Bracing under peaceful conditions

In combat the few methods of bracing mentioned so far will be found by cavalry and infantry (as the case may be) to be the best, the most practicable, and the easiest to use. Under safer and more leisurely conditions, on the other hand, one good way of bracing is to sit cross-legged, putting the right leg inside the left. Seated squarely in this position, the archer fixes the loop of his bowstring in the nock of one or the other of the *siyahs* and, with his right hand, keeps it in place at the base of the bow's neck. Holding the remaining loop in his mouth he now takes the other neck in hos left hand, sets the grip beneath his right thigh, and tightening his hold on the bow as he pulls it up with both hands.  The *siyah*, which is taken in his left hand he sets on top of the left thigh, leaving that hand free to take hold of the loop in his mouth. Then, pulling the bow with his right hand, he bends his body over the left thigh so that he can slip the free loop into its nock. This done, he examines the limb and his bow as previously directed.

An alternative method may be used. He again sits squarely (on the ground) and fixes a loop in the nock of one of the *siyahs*, but this time gives the free loop to someone near at hand. Taking the necks of the bow in both hands, he places the centre of the grip beneath his right knee or, [better sti], in behind both knees, and proceeds to flex the bow with both hands together. He then tells the person holding the free loop to slip it into the nock. This done, he parts his legs inside the bow (thereby bringing his thighs to bear on the *dustārs*) and sets the *siyahs* as truly as he can. What he should do is to look at the stronger limb of his bow (i.e. the lower, which is liable to bend less than the upper) and put more thigh against it, at the same time easing the thigh which is pressed against his weaker limb, [but at no time allowing his hands to leave either neck]. He sits in this position for quite some time until he feels sure that the bow has settled. He then removes one thigh and looks, and, if he thinks that the bow has in fact settled, he may take out the other. If it has not, however, he should replace his thigh (and wait until it has).

This method of bracing is most suitable for bows that are apt to quiver and spin round and in cases where the bow is a good deal older than its string, It is also better for the bow. By applying this technique an intelligent man can bring his bow to the required curve without a bracing-board (*kharkumān*) either because he wishes to display his skill and knowledge or because the want of a bracing-board leaves him no alternative.

A useful piece of equipment for bracing purposes is the *barshaq*, which is a strap or cord with which the string is held fast to the weaker limb. [Two may be needed for one bow according to the requirements of the case.] If the bow, for instance, is a self bow and there is danger of one of the limbs giving way, a *barshaq* should be applied to each limb to hold it in check.

A knowledge of things of this kind should be regarded by an archer as a sort of religious obligation because of the frequency with which the need to apply it will arise in combat and on campaign.

Where one limb of a bow is weaker than the other, the stronger of the two should be heated over a gentle fire. If no fire is available, the archer should put his hand around it and briskly rub it up and down for a time until it gets warm, If on campaign in winter when the weather is cold, his best policy is to put the bow inside his clothes and warm it with his body. When going to bed at night, he should also keep the bow inside his clothes to protect it against the damp.

When on campaign, an archer should never neglect his bow for a single moment, and in extremes of temperature he should inspect it [day and night, hour by hour, and not let it out of his mind, even though he be absolutely certain that it is stable and true]. Moreover, he should Protect his hands against the cold in the early morning lest, needing to shoot, his limbs and fingers fail to respond, leaving him unable to shoot at all or, if able to do so, unable to equal his usual performance. This is a rule which should not be ignored, for 'he who neglects to do what he ought, may repent when repentance will avail him not'.

## Bracing a stiff bow

The way to brace a stiff bow is to take the upper *siyah* with your right hand and, in a standing position, to place your right leg in between the bow and the string, keeping the bowstring on top of your shin and the belly of the bow against the rear of your right thigh beneath the hip-joint. You then put the tip of the lower *siyah* against the front of your left leg and, with your right hand on the upper *siyah* and your left hand holding the loop of the string, you push your right hand forward. You may, alternatively, hold the neck of the bow with your left hand, place the lower *siyah* against the front of your right leg, and, putting your left leg between the bow and the string, push with the left hand as you hold the loop in your right.

If the bow is too strong to be braced in this way, you should use a broad strap two cubits long and four fingers wide (about 4 ft. 4 in. x 3 in.). To the ends of this you fit two loops made of either bowstring or leather of the same sort as your string's chafing protector (*saysarah*). You next put the strap behind your back as you would when drawing a stirrup crossbow. If the bow has two nocks in each *siyah*, you put one loop in each nock. If your bow is not so made, however, you can have two hooks on your drawing-strap instead of two loops, or else secure the loops to the *siyahs*. Then, drawing with your waist, you push with your feet [against the centre of the bow’s grip] and attach the string. There is no need to enlarge on a subject which can be dismissed briefly once the gist is grasped. i

## On bracing a bow in water

To brace in water, you put your head between the string and the bow with the bow’s grip on your shoulder [at the nape of your neck] and each loop of string positioned in the centre of each neck. With a hand on each loop and neck you apply pressure with both palms together until the loops fall into the nocks in your *siyahs*. Alternatively, you may hold each neck with your hands, having one loop fixed in the bow and the other in your mouth, and then bend the bow with your hands until you get the nock which is in its *siyah* into the loop that is in your mouth. This requires a good deal of practice, but it is one of the finer points of bowmanship. If you propose to shoot, you hold your bow crosswise and use it in that position.
